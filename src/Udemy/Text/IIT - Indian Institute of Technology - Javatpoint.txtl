These institutes also rank higher in the top institutes in Asia. IITs are in demand as they offer all-around development to enrolled students and play a major role in starting their careers. IITs make students successful through the courses offered. Indian students are attracted by the IITs, as these are prestigious institutes of the country. The process and preparation for the exam are all worth it as IITs offer programs that are of the level of the top institutes worldwide. History 1945: The government of India appointed a committee of educators, industrialists, and scientists, with twenty-two members. Sir Ardeshir Dalal founded the committee. The aim of the committee was to support industrial development with an adequate supply of technical personnel. Four Higher Technical Institutions were made on the recommendation of the committee in the north, south, east, and west. The model of the IITs was inspired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Afterwards, IIT Kolkata was built near Calcutta, and IIT Bombay was established near Mumbai. 1950: Sir J.C. Ghosh became the founding director of the first institute, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 1950. 1951: Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, education minister then, inaugurated IIT Kharagpur in West Bengal in August 1951. 1952: The cornerstone for the institute was laid on 3 March 1951 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. 1956: It was opened on 21 April 1956, and the Indian Parliament passed an act known as the Indian Institute Technology (Kharagpur) Act. It was done on 15 September 1956 on the convocation of the first graduates of IIT Kharagpur. 1958: Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) was formed in collaboration with the Soviet Union in 1958. 1959: IIT Madras was established in collaboration with West Germany in 1959. 1960: 1960 is the year of the formation of the IIT Kanpur, which collaborates with a few top American Universities led by MIT. 1961: An act known as the Institutes of Technology Act was passed by the Indian Parliament; it declared each IIT as an 'Institution of Importance'. 1963: College of Engineering and Technology was upgraded to form IIT Delhi. It was established at Hauz Khas in New Delhi and was formed in collaboration with the British. 1995: IIT Guwahati was established near the Brahmaputra River in Assam. It was the sixth IIT. IIT Guwahati did not have any formal collaboration with any other country. By the time IIT Guwahati was established, the system of IITs had become strong. The creation of IIT Guwahati was done for the development of the Northeast region of India. Some local leaders initiated the project of development, and it was a part of the Assam Accord reached by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 2001: The University of Roorkee, which is the oldest technical institute of India, became an IIT on 21 September 2001, and it came to be known as the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. The upgradation of the University of Roorkee to IIT Roorkee took place through an ordinance by the president of India. It was situated in Uttaranchal, which was a newly created state at that time. The First IIT IIT Kharagpur is the first and one of the largest technical institutes of India. It offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in almost all disciplines of engineering and technology. The institute is popular for its largest technical library in Asia. The computing facilities at IIT Kharagpur are also one of the largest computing facilities in India. There are 19 academic departments, 9 research centers, and 8 academic centers and schools in IIT Kharagpur. The Process of Admission Indian students are attracted by the IIT, as these are prestigious institutes of the country. However, the admission process is rigorous, and students have to go through it to get into IITs. The process and preparation for the exam are all worth it as IITs offer programs that are of the level of the top institutes worldwide. Joint Entrance Examination is conducted for undergraduate admissions, and passing the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is necessary for postgraduate admissions in IITs. It is tough to compete in these exams as only 2 percent of the students who undergo screening are selected for the final admissions. The newly added programs at IITs are Master of Science in various science and mathematics and Master of Business Administration. IITs offer a four-year program bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) to undergraduate students, and it is offered in various engineering branches in seven IITs. A candidate must write and qualify the national-level entrance exam in science and mathematics to be eligible for admission to any IITs. Additionally, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Roorkee offer a bachelor of architecture (B.Arch.), a five-year program. There are some prerequisites to be eligible for financial assistance from the government. These include passing GATE, bachelor's degree in engineering (for M.Tech. admissions). Vision and Development Every IIT has a different set of vision and mission. However, there is something that remains the same about these statements. These statements include education, creativity, excellence, holistic scope, nurturing academic freedom, innovation, integrity, and overall development. IITs emphasize national relevance and global understanding, and this system strives for the best quality in all endeavors. IIT Delhi aims at development in technology transfer and innovation. The technology and Business incubation units are established to promote the knowledge of science and generate research ideas. Science and Technology Entrepreneurship parks are located in IIT Kharagpur and IIT Roorkee. The other IITs take many such programs and initiatives that aim to promote entrepreneurship and technology transfer. Major contributions in the field of communication systems are made by the IIT Madras, which promotes technology transfer.

Multiple correct answer type questions, integer type questions, and Multiple choice questions with a single correct type are asked in JEE-Advanced. JEE-Mains involves only a single correct answer type question in the whole paper. Moreover, a candidate must qualify JEE-Mains to become eligible for the JEE-Advanced paper. Admission to IIT is provided to the students on the basis of their JEE rank. GATE GATE is popularly known as the Master's program in engineering. It is well known in India for the Master's programs in Engineering. Students studying in the final or pre-final years of engineering are eligible to appear for the GATE exam. The syllabus of GATE comprises the portion covered in the four years of the engineering degree in a specific branch. It is necessary to have completed the Undergraduate degree in Engineering, and the candidate must also qualify GATE with a good rank to get admission in prestigious IITs. GATE opens many other opportunities for the candidates, such as PSUS (Public Sector Undertakings), etc. It is also necessary to secure a good rank and score in GATE for financial aid while pursuing postgraduate programs. It includes Government scholarships and assistantships. Some colleges and universities in India and abroad also use the GATE score for admission to the Master's Program in Engineering. The GATE score remains valid for three years after the date of the announcement of the exam for that year.
