There are different approaches followed by the designers to make a text outline. Few of them are required to rasterize the text, but that is not a good approach because, at a later point, you want to make some changes in your style, then it may be complicated to update that. In this section, we will discuss the easiest and efficient method to make the text outline. We will be using the layer style option stroke to provide our text a colorful outline. The values and colors we are going to use to educate you, you can choose any of the color value and outline radius as per your need.

We can select it from the toolbox; alternatively, we can press the T key.

Step6: Remove text color This step is optional if you want your text-only outlined and remove the color. To remove the text color, either you can remove fill by making the text layer fill to 0%, or you can fill it with white color. To remove the color from the text, navigate to layers and select the text layer; just above the layers panel at the top-right corner, the fill option will be displayed. Make it to 0% to remove the color fill from the text. It will remove the color from the text. Now, only text with an outline will be displayed: Now, we can have any background image or background color on this document to make it more stylish. The modern version of Photoshop provides more control over the outline. For example, we can have another stroke over this stroke so that it will look more attractive. The process of adding another outline over this outline will be the same as discussed. You will find an extra stroke option in the layer styles. You can apply the repeat stroke operation by selecting the blending options from the layer menu. Summary: We have discussed how to outline text in Photoshop.
