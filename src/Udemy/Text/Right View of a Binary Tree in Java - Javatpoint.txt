            Right View of a Binary Tree in Java In this section, we will learn about the right view of a binary tree in Java and the different approaches to achieve it. In the right view of a binary tree, we print only those nodes of the binary tree that are visible when the binary tree is viewed from the right. For the following binary tree:  The right view of the above binary tree is: 20 8 5 10 7 Note: In the right view of a Binary Tree, the order in which the nodes are displayed in the output is not relevant. One should care about is that all of the nodes that are visible from the right side of the binary tree should be included in the output. Approach 1: Using Recursion The approach is to use the recursion to find the right view of the binary tree. A parameter can be passed to all of the recursive calls to find the level of a node. Whenever we come across a node whose level is more than the maximum level found so far, we display that node. It is because it is the last node encountered at this level. Since we have to display the right view of a binary tree, we have to traverse in such a way that the right subtree is visited before the left subtree. Implementation Let's see the implementation of the right view of a binary tree using recursion. The following code takes the O(n) time to complete its job, and the space complexity of the program is also O(n) because of the stack used in the recursive calls, where n is the total number of nodes present in the binary tree. FileName: RightViewExample.java 
           
            
// class representing the node of a binary tree.
class BTNode 
{
// for keeping the value of a node
int val;

// lt and rt are the representatives of the  
// right child and the left child of a node
BTNode lt, rt;

// constructor of the class BTNode
// it initializes the class fields
public BTNode(int j)
{
val = j;
rt = null;
lt = null;
}
}

public class RightViewExample 
{
BTNode r;
int maxLevel = 0; // for the maximum level

// recursive method to display the right view
public void rightViewUtility(BTNode nde, int lvl)
{
// handling the base Case
if (nde == null)
{
return;
}

// we have found the first node of its level.
if (maxLevel < lvl) 
{
// printing the value of the first node at its level
System.out.print(nde.val + " ");

// updating the value of maxLevel
maxLevel = lvl;
}

// Recurring for the right subtree
rightViewUtility(nde.rt, lvl + 1);

// Recurring for the left subtree
rightViewUtility(nde.lt, lvl + 1);
}

// A wrapper method over the rightViewUtility() method
public void rightView()
{
rightViewUtility(r, 1);
}

// main method
public static void main(String argvs[])
{
// creating an object of the class RightViewExample
RightViewExample rv = new RightViewExample();


// root node
rv.r = new BTNode(20);

// other nodes of the tree
rv.r.lt = new BTNode(22);
rv.r.rt = new BTNode(8);
rv.r.lt.lt = new BTNode(25);
rv.r.lt.rt = new BTNode(3);
rv.r.rt.rt = new BTNode(5);
rv.r.lt.rt.rt = new BTNode(10);
rv.r.lt.rt.lt = new BTNode(14);
rv.r.lt.rt.lt.rt = new BTNode(7);
System.out.println("The following are the nodes present in the right view of the Binary Tree: ");
// invoking the method rightView()
rv.rightView();
}
}

            Output: 
           
            The following are the nodes present in the right view of the Binary Tree: 
20 8 5 10 7

            Approach 2: Using Queue() If we observe carefully, we will find that the right view of a binary tree is the last node encountered at every level. Therefore, we can use the queue data structure to traverse each level of the binary tree. At each level, we print only the value of the last node found at each level. Implementation Let's see the implementation of the right view of a binary tree using the queue. The time complexity of the below program is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes present in the tree. FileName: RightViewExample1.java 
           
            
// import important statement
import java.util.*;

// class representing the node of a binary tree.
class BTNode 
{
// for keeping the value of a node
int val;

// lt and rt are the representatives of the  
// right child and the left child of a node
BTNode lt, rt;

// constructor of the class BTNode
// it initializes the class fields
public BTNode(int j)
{
val = j;
rt = null;
lt = null;
}
}
public class RightViewExample1 
{
BTNode r = null;
// method to display the right view of the binary tree
public void displayRightView()
{
if (r == null)
{
return;
}
Queue<BTNode> que = new LinkedList<>();
que.add(r);
while (!que.isEmpty()) 
{
// number of nodes at current level
int siz = que.size();
// Traverse all nodes of current level
for (int j = 1; j <= siz; j++) 
{
BTNode tmp = que.poll();
// displaying the value of the right most node at
// each level
if (j == siz)
{
System.out.print(tmp.val + " ");
}
// Adding the left node to the queue
if (tmp.lt != null)
{
que.add(tmp.lt);
}
// Adding the right node to the queue
if (tmp.rt != null)
{
que.add(tmp.rt);
}
}
}
}
// main method
public static void main(String argvs[])
{
// creating an object of the class RightViewExample1
RightViewExample1 rv = new RightViewExample1();
// root node
rv.r = new BTNode(20);
// remaining nodes of the tree
rv.r.lt = new BTNode(22);
rv.r.rt = new BTNode(8);
rv.r.lt.lt = new BTNode(25);
rv.r.lt.rt = new BTNode(3);
rv.r.rt.rt = new BTNode(5);
rv.r.lt.rt.rt = new BTNode(10);
rv.r.lt.rt.lt = new BTNode(14);
rv.r.lt.rt.lt.rt = new BTNode(7);
System.out.println("The following are the nodes present in the right view of the Binary Tree: ");
// invoking the method displayRightView()
rv.displayRightView();
}
}

            Output: 
           
            The following are the nodes present in the right view of the Binary Tree: 
20 8 5 10
