            Top 10 Scooty In India Scooty has always played an important role in the Indian market and its customers' life. Over the decades, the scooters have upgraded with modern design and technology which converted them into scooty. Even today, when there are lots of powerful bikes available in the market, the scooty has its charm and value due to their regular up-gradation. Some of the smart reasons why people prefer scooty over bikes include the following: 
            
            Usability: Scooty is the best choice to cover short-distance and quick rides. Its structure, machinery, rapid acceleration, mobility, and lightweight increase its usability for quick hops.

            Safety: Scooty is easy to drive and it runs at a lower speed which makes it safer than bikes. Other than this, one can easily handle the scooty if get unbalanced. It is due to their manageable height and weight while it is quite hard in the case of the bikes.
