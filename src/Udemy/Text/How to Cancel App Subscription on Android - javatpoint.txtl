Subscription on Android Nowadays, app subscriptions have become more common; people are using single or multiple subscription services. Almost all apps provide a subscription plan, including gaming, music, TV, and video streaming content. Some of Google Play's applications even offer free trials for a few days. People are using monthly paid apps for their needs and interests. But if you are no longer using any of your app subscriptions and want to discontinue, you can cancel it anytime. If you are not sure how to do that through the app itself, Android's Google Play Store makes it easier to access your entire subscription apps in one place. You can cancel any app subscription from your Google Play Store account. When you even cancel a subscription plan in the middle of the month, you will still use their services until the paid plan month gets complete. After that, your subscription plan ends, and you can't be able to use the subscription service, and you will revert to the non-subscription version. How to cancel App subscriptions on an Android via Google Play Store Users can cancel their app subscriptions on Android through Google Play Store account. Through your Play Store subscription account, you can also manage and review your device-based app subscriptions.
