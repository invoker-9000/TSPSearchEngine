            Primitive Data Type Primitive is the most fundamental data type usable in the Programming language. There are eight primitive data types: Boolean, byte, character, short, int, long, float, and double. In a Programming language, these data types serve as the foundation for data manipulation. All basic data types are built-in into the majority of programming languages. Furthermore, many languages provide a set of composite data types. Primitive data types may or may not have a one-to-one correspondence with objects in the computer's memory, depending on the language and its implementation. However, operations on basic primitive data types are typically thought to be the fastest language constructs. For example, integer addition can be performed as a single machine instruction, and some processors provide specific instructions for processing character sequences with a single instruction. The C standard specifically states that "a 'plain' int object has the natural size suggested by the execution environment's architecture". On a 32-bit architecture, this means that int will most likely be 32 bits long. Value types are always basic primitive types. Most programming languages do not allow programmes to change the behaviour or capabilities of primitive (built-in or basic) data types. Smalltalk is an exception, allowing all data types to be extended within a programme, expanding the operations that can be performed on them or even redefining the built-in operations. Such data types serve a single purpose: they contain pure, simple values of a type. Because these data types are defined by default in the Programming languages type system, they come with a set of predefined operations. Such primitive types cannot have new operations defined. There are three more types of primitives in the Java type system: 
            
            Short, int, long, float, and double are the numerical primitives. These primitive data types can only store numbers. Simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) or comparison operations are associated with such data types (greater than, equal to, etc.) 
            Textual primitives include bytes and characters. Characters are stored in these primitive data types (that can be Unicode alphabets or even numbers). Textual manipulation operations are associated with data types (comparing two words, joining characters to make words, etc.). However, byte and char can perform arithmetic operations as well. 
            Primitives with boolean and null values: boolean and null. 
            The actual number of primitive data types available is determined by the programming language that is used. Strings, for instance, are a composite but built-in data type in C#, even as they are integrated to a primitive data type that is both basic and built-in in advanced accents of BASIC and JavaScript. Considering the Java Programming language, the primitive data structures include integers, floats, characters, and pointers. In general, there are 8 data types. They are as follows: 
            
            Boolean data type 
            byte data type 
            char data type 
            short data type 
            int data type 
            long data type 
            float data type 
            double data type 
            Boolean Data Type A Boolean data type comprises a single bit of information that can only store true or false values. True or false conditions are tracked using this data type, and Boolean data types are also used to store the result of various conditions. Let's write a small program and see how it works. 
           
            
class booleanDataType{
public static void main(String args[]){
// Setting the values for boolean data type
boolean Java = true;
boolean Python = false;
System.out.println(Java);   // Output will be true
System.out.println(Python);  // Output will be false
}
}

            Byte Data Type The byte data type is an illustration of a primitive data type. It is a signed two's complement integer of 8 bits, and it stores whole numbers ranging from -128 to 127. A byte data type is useful for saving large amounts of memory. Let's write a small program and see how it works. 
           
            
class ByteExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
byte n, a;
n = 127;
a=177;
System.out.println(n); // prints 127
System.out.println(a); // throws an error because it cannot store more than 127 bits
}
}

            Char Data Type A single character is stored in this data type, and the character must be enclosed in single quotes, such as 'E' or 'e'. You can also use ASCII values to display specific characters. Let's look at a simple example to see how it works. 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//storing a single character
		char  alpha = 'J';
 		//storing the ASCII of the respective character or alphabets
		char a = 65;
		char b = 66, 
		char c = 67;		
		System.out.println(alpha); // prints J
		System.out.println(a); // Displays 65
		System.out.println(b); // Displays 66
		System.out.println(c); // Displays 67

	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class

            Short Data Type A short data type is larger than a byte but smaller than an integer, and it saves values ranging from -32,768 to 32767. This data type's default size is 2 bytes. Let's look at an example to understand the short data type better. 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		short n= 3435,
		System.out.println(n); // prints the value present in n i.e. 3435

	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class

            Int Data Type This data type is capable of storing whole numbers ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647. When creating variables with numeric values, int is generally the preferred data type. 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 5464564;
		System.out.println(num); // prints 5464564
	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class

            Long Data Type This data type is a two's complement 64-bit integer. A long data type's default size is 64 bits, and its value ranges from -263 to 263-1. 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {		
		// a variable named num of long is created to store the long value
		long num = 15000000000L;
		// The output of the below System.out.println will print 15000000000 that is the value stored in num
		System.out.println(num); 
		// a variable named num1 of long is created to store the long value
		long num1 = 897155L;
		// The output of the below System.out.println will print 897155 that is the value stored in num1
		System.out.println(num); 
	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class

            Float Data Type It would be best to use a floating-point type when you need a number with a decimal, such as 8.88 or 3.14515. This data type supports fractional numbers ranging from 3.4e038 to 3.4e+038. It is important to note that the value should end with an "f." Let's look at a specific example to understand this data type better. 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {		
		// a variable named num of float type is created to store the float value
		float num =67;
		// The output of the below System.out.println will print 897155 that is the value stored in num
		System.out.println(num); // prints the floating number value
	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class

            Double Data Type The double data type can store fractional numbers from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308. Note that you should end the value with a "d": 
           
            
public class PrimitiveDataType{
	public static void main(String[] args) {		
		// a variable named num of double type is created to store the double value
		double num = 79.678d;		
		// The output of the below System.out.println will print 79.678 that is the value stored in num
		System.out.println(num); // prints the double number value 
	}//end of main function
}//end of PrimitiveDataType class
