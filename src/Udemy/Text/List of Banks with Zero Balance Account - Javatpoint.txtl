Everyone wants that their money should be kept in a safe place and they should be able to use their money when needed. In modern times everyone can keep their money safe in the bank and can use their money whenever they want and to deposit money in the bank, we need to open a savings account in the bank. There are many types of savings accounts, out of which, we have described Zero Balance Saving Account. Let us see how many banks provide us with the facility to open Zero Balance Saving Account. Drawback of Normal Saving Account If you want to open a savings account in any bank or if you already have a savings account in any bank then you must know that you need a minimum balance to open a savings account in any bank. Each bank has its fixed minimum balance. A minimum balance is the minimum amount of money that account holders must maintain in their savings account, as determined by the bank. So if you want to open a savings account, you have to keep a minimum amount in your savings account. If you do not do this then you will have to pay a fine to the bank. So, you cannot withdraw that minimum amount unless you want to close your account. Need for a Zero Balance Bank Account? We saw in the above paragraph that if we want to open a normal savings account, we need to deposit a minimum amount of money, this creates a lot of problems such as; You have to maintain that minimum required amount in your savings account as long as you have an account in the bank. Many poor people do not have enough money to deposit the minimum required amount. Sometimes in case of emergency, we need to withdraw all the money that we have in our savings account. If we do so we have to pay extra charges to the bank. What is a Zero Balance Savings Account? A zero balance saving account is the type of saving account in which we do not have to deposit any amount of money as a minimum required balance. In other words, we can say that many banks provide us with a facility in which we do not have to deposit money in our savings account as a minimum balance. And, we do not have to pay any extra charges to withdraw all the money from our bank account. The benefits of a Zero Balance Account Poor people who were not able to open their bank account due to the problem of maintaining a minimum balance in the bank can now easily open their account in the bank. We all know that maintaining a minimum balance is a very difficult task and in a zero balance savings account, we do not have to think more about maintaining an amount as a minimum balance.
