We can set true shadows and lightning to provide our object with a professional look. In Ecommerce graphics, it is necessary to highlight the product to attract users.

In this section, we will discuss what the drop shadows are? How it works, and how to apply it to different objects and text. What Are Drop Shadows Used For? The essential use of the drop shadow is to simulate 3D depth in a 2D image. We can do this by setting the offset shadow behind the object to focus and indicate that it is hovering from its background. We can apply a drop shadow by applying the layers styles and effects in Photoshop. To add a drop shadow to an image or text, select the required layer and click on the "FX" icon at the bottom of the layer panel. Now, select the Drop Shadow option from the given layer styles to apply it to the image or text layer. It will open a dialogue box to add additional settings such as size, position, and the softness of the shadow. From this window, we can select from various effects to improve the view of the drop shadow in our object. We can choose a simple black shadow or spice it up with attractive colors. Thus, we can easily customize the shadow for our object.

To open the image in Photoshop, press the Ctrl+O key. It will open the file explorer, select the file from your file system and press open to continue. It will open the image in the Photoshop workspace. We are using a PNG image with transparent background for a clear view of the effect.

We will apply the shadow effect on this image so that it looks like in a realistic environment.

To create a new layer, press the Ctrl + Shift + N keys; It will open a dialogue window to specify the layer name and layer color. Do not confuse the term layer color; here, the layer color specifies the stripe color, which denotes the layer, not the layer's background colour. Click OK to create a new layer. Once we create a layer, it will be reflected in the layers panel given at the bottom-right of the workspace window as our document is transparent, so it will create a new transparent layer.

Now, it looks like placed in a real-world environment. Step5: Save Image Now, save the image in any of the required image formats supported by Photoshop. We can save it in different image formats such as Jpg, Png, Gif, etc. We can also save it in PSD format to keep the file work with layers so that we can edit it later if needed. To save it in PSD format, press the Ctrl+S key combination and to save it in any other format, press the Ctrl+Shift+S or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S for saving as web options. Specify the file name and format and save it in your local storage. Drop Shadow to Text We can also add the drop shadow to the text, just like an image. The steps are the same for the text also. We have to create a text layer and apply the shadow effect on the text layer. Let's understand how to apply a drop shadow to text. Step1: Create a Text Layer The first step is to create a new text layer; we can create a new layer to add a new text layer or add to an existing document.

Now, add some text to our image to add the shadow to it. We can update the text size, color, font family and other settings using the top options bar. It contains different options to customize the text. Once we finalized the text format, we can apply the drop shadow to our text. The text layer will be reflected in our layers panel given at the bottom right to the workspace. To add the drop shadow, make the text layer active by clicking on it. Step2: Select the Layer Blending Options Now, right-click on the text layer to open the layer menu options and select the blending options from the menu. It will open a dialogue window having the layer style options. Select the drop shadow option from this menu to apply the drop shadow on the text.

Our image will look as follows: In the above image, we applied a drop shadow effect to highlight the text from the background. Similarly, you can use your custom shadow effect to make your text more attractive. How to Apply Best Drop Shadow Settings Before applying the drop shadow effect, we should consider which types of shadow will be a good suit for our image. Basically, shadows are two types which are cast shadows and form shadows. The difference between both the shadows is the shadow positions. Let's understand what cast shadows and form shadows are? Cast Shadow The cast shadow reflects the object on the surface, which looks like a different object. It is typically around the main object. Shadow of a wall on the ground is an example of a cast shadow. The purpose of the cast shadow is to show a distinction between the shadowed part of an object and the main object. Form Shadow The form shadow is a reflection of an object opposite to the light source. However, there are few other parameters that define the cast shadow and form shadow. Following are the parameters that define the cast shadow and form shadow. The light direction of the object Light distance from the object Available light sources To understand the complete work procedure of the shadow, we have to understand how the shadow works. Usually, cast shadows are blurrier and lighter because they are more focused on the object. Difference between Drop Shadow and Cast Shadow Adding a realistic shadow to an object is pretty much a complicated and realistic task. The cast shadow is a reflection of the object on the surface, which looks like a different object. It is typically around the main object. Shadow of a wall on the ground is an example of a cast shadow. Comparatively, adding a drop shadow is a straightforward process than adding a cast shadow. A cast shadow represents a rough shadow having the same size and dimension as the object. So we have to adjust the cast shadow in a 3D dimension. To adjust the cast shadow properly, we have to follow the above-discussed process efficiently to make it look realistic and professional.
