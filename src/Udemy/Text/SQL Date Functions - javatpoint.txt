            SQL Date Functions In this tutorial, we will learn about some of the important date functions which are in-built in SQL. Date functions in SQL: 
            
            NOW() 
            CURDATE() 
            CURTIME() 
            DATE() 
            EXTRACT() 
            DATE_ADD() 
            DATE_SUB() 
            DATEDIFF() 
            DATE_FORMAT() 
            Let us see each of the date functions one by one in detail with the help of examples. We will be using MySQL database in examples for writing the queries. Consider we have the student table with the following data: 
            
            
              
              ID 
              Name 
              DateTime_Birth 
              City

            We will be using this table in some of the examples. 1. NOW(): NOW () function in SQL will give the current system's date and time. Syntax: 
           
            
SELECT NOW ();

            Example: Write a query to display the current system's date and time. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT NOW () AS Current_Date_Time; 

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the NOW () function to get the system's current date and time. Current_Date_Time is an alias to store the date and time. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              Current_Date_Time 
              
              
              2021-10-24 18:28:44 
              
            
            The date and time at which the query was executed in the system are 24th October 2021 and 18:28:44. Hence, it is displayed as an output. 2. CURDATE() CURDATE () function in SQL will give the current system's date. Syntax: 
           
            
SELECT CURDATE ();

            Example: Write a query to display the current system's date. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT CURDATE () AS CurrentDate;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the CURDATE () function to get the system's current date. CurrentDate is an alias to store the date. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              CurrentDate 
              
              
              2021-10-24 
              
            
            The date on which the query was executed in the system is 24th October 2021. Hence, it is displayed as an output. 3. CURTIME() CURTIME () function in SQL will give the current system time. Syntax: 
           
            
SELECT CURTIME ();

            Example: Write a query to display the current system's time. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT CURTIME () AS CurrentTime;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the CURTIME () function to get the system's current time. CurrentTime is an alias to store the time. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              CurrentTime 
              
              
              18:49:07 
              
            
            The time at which the query was executed in the system is 18:49:07. Hence, it is displayed as an output. 4. DATE() Using the DATE () function in SQL, you can specifically extract the date from the DATETIME datatype column. Syntax: 
           
            
SELECT DATE (DateTimeValue);

            Example 1: Write a query to display the date from the given date and time, i.e., 2021-10-24 18:28:44. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT DATE ("2021-10-24 18:28:44") AS SHOW_DATE;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the DATE () function to get only the date from the date and time parameter passed to the DATE() function. SHOW_DATE is an alias to store the date. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              SHOW_DATE 
              
              
              2021-10-24 
              
            
            From the date and time parameter i.e., '2021-10-24 18:28:44', the date value is 2021-10-24. Hence, it is displayed as an output. Example 2: Write a query to display all the details from the student table with the date from the DateTime_Birth column of the student table. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT ID, Name, DATE(DateTime_Birth) AS Date_of_Birth, City FROM student;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query to fetch the ID and Name. Date_of_Birth is an alias for DateTime_Birth. We have used the Date_of_Birth with the DATE () function to get only the date. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              ID 
              Name 
              Date_of_Birth 
              City

            All the records are displayed as it is from the student table except for the DateTime_Birth column. Only the date is displayed in the Date_of_Birth column as per the requirement. 5. EXTRACT() Using the EXTRACT() function in SQL, we can extract a specific part of date and time according to our requirements: day, month, year, day, hour, minute, etc. Syntax: 
           
            
SELECT EXTRACT (PART FROM DATE / TIME);

            Example 1: Write a query to display the year from the given date, i.e., 24th October 2021. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT (YEAR FROM "2021-10-24") AS SHOW_YEAR;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the EXTRACT () function to get the year from the given date. SHOW_YEAR is an alias to store the year. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              SHOW_YEAR 
              
              
              2021 
              
            
            '2021' is the year in the given date. Hence, it is displayed as an output. Example 2: Write a query to display the month from the given date, i.e., 24th October 2021. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM "2021-10-24") AS SHOW_MONTH;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the EXTRACT () function to get the month from the given date. SHOW_MONTH is an alias to store the month. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              SHOW_MONTH 
              
              
              10 
              
            
            10th is the month value in the given date. Hence, it is displayed as an output. Example 3: Write a query to display the day from the given date, i.e., 24th October 2021. Query: 
           
            
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT (DAY FROM "2021-10-24") AS SHOW_DAY;

            Here, we have written a SELECT query with the EXTRACT () function to get the day from the given date. SHOW_DAY is an alias to store the day. After executing the above query, we got the following output: 
            
            
              
              SHOW_DAY 
              
              
              24 
              
            
            24th is the day value in the given date. Hence, it is displayed as an output. Example 4: Write a query to display the hour from the given time, i.e., 19:10:43. Query:
