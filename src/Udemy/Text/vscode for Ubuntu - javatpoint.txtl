It is a strong code editor that is open-source developed via Microsoft. Visual Studio Code contains built-in support for debugging, snippets, code refactoring, integrated terminal, code completion, syntax highlighting, and embedded Git control. Vscode is cross-platform and available on macOS, Linux, and Windows. We can install vscode as the deb package using Microsoft repositories or snap package using the Snapcraft store. Also, we can select the method of installation that is most convenient for our environment. The recommended and easiest way for installing vscode On Ubuntu systems is to set up the repository of vscode and install the package of vscode using the command-line or terminal. The cross-platform feature of the Visual Studio Code is a major part of its claim as developers do not need to change tools or study new UIs if swapping platforms. All features of vscode are virtually available to every user, regardless of the features of their operating system like integrated terminal, embedded Git control, intelligent auto-completion, syntax highlighting and debugging. Also, the editor includes the great support of languages like Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript. A rich collection of extensions is also available for other types of languages such as Go, PHP, Python, Java, C#, and C++, and runtimes such as Unity and .Net. In this article, we will show two ways to install vscode in the 20.04 version of Ubuntu. Install vscode (using Snap package) Microsoft gives an official vscode Snap package on the Snapcraft store of Canonical. Snap is software packages (self-contained) that contain the binary dependency required to execute the application. Every snap package is secure and easy to upgrade. We can install these Snap packages with the help of the command-line or Ubuntu Software application. We need to open the application, i.e., Ubuntu Software and, find "Visual Studio Code" with the name to install vscode using the Ubuntu Software application. If we are alternatively more familiar with the command-line, then we can use the terminal and execute the following command: 
$ sudo snap install code -classic
 That's all we need to implement for getting vscode installed on our system. No worries about future updates as there are newer versions of vscode that are downloaded and installed automatically inside the background as we use our computer. Install vscode (deb package) Microsoft manages an apt repository for the user of Linux for installing vscode using this repository. We can add the apt repository of the vscode by hand with the terminal or command line. However, a faster way for getting it fixed up on our computer is to download and install the Visual Studio Code Linux package using the website of the application. As a part of the process of installation, the apt repository will get added to the Software Sources list. We need to go to our folder of Downloads (or the location we selected for saving the installer) when the downloading process is complete and then double-click over the .deb file. The Ubuntu Software would open. After that, press the "install" button. We can update the package of Visual Studio Code (with other updates we have) with the Software updater tool of Ubuntu when a newer version is published. Install vscode (Flatpak) If we have Flatpak (or Flathub) fixed up on our system, then we can install the package of the Visual Studio Code using Flathub. Ubuntu doesn't support Flatpak. We will have to install the package, i.e., gnome-software as well for GUI installation. Note: The Flatpak of the Visual Studio Code is not managed by Microsoft. Visual Studio Code (Open) To open Visual Studio Code on the Ubuntu system, we need to just press on the icon, i.e., 'Applications' at the Ubuntu Dock base (or press the super key). Within the search bar begin to enter "Visual Studio Code", then press the icon to open the application at the time the icon of the app appears. We need to just execute code for opening the app using the command line. Then, we are free to install the extensions of Visual Studio Code, customize the user interface, and enjoying the huge set of features provided. For enabling the mode, i.e., 'dual pane', we need to press the "[|]" icon which is close to the tab bar. Next Topic Android Studio Ubuntu ? prev next ?
