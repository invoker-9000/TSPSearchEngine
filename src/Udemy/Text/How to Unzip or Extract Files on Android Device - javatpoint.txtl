Extract Files on Android Device Archive files are used to compress files and folders to minimize their size or make a bundle of files. Archive or zip files come in use while you want to share content with someone else. Zip or compressed files occupy less storage than uncompressed files. Another advantage of zip files is that they are quicker transferable. Some of the popular archive formats are .zip, .rar, .tar, 7z, etc. If you are looking for how to unzip or extract ZIP files on Android, you are in the right place. We will discuss various methods and third-party apps to unzip or extract files on an Android phone or tablet. Unzip files on Android using Files by Google app In the terms of ZIP files, the unzip means extracting the files from the compressed archive folder. The official app to unzip the compressed folder on Android phones is Files by Google. You can unzip files on an Android device using the Files by Google app, to do so follow the given steps. Visit Google Play Store and download and install the Files by Google app on your Android phone. Keep in mind; if your device OS hasn't been updated, this app may appear as Files Go on an Android device. Open the Files by Google app and give access to your storage if it asks for permission. Now, click on the Browse button present at the bottom of the app screen. Locate the ZIP file you want to extract or unzip. If you have downloaded the ZIP file from a website, it may be present in the Downloads folder (as it is a default setting). Find the zip folder you wish to unzip. Tap on the Extract button to unzip the file, the list of extracted files appears. Once the files are extracted, a pop-up menu appears that displays what files have been extracted. By default, the zip folders remain in your Android phone after extracting the files. You can select a checkbox to delete the ZIP folder that saves space on your Android phone. Finally, tap on the Finished button to complete the steps. Other Popular Unzippers or Extractor for Android As the Files by Google app lets you unzip your ZIP files, most Android phone manufacturers provide a pre-installed file manager app on their smartphones to extract ZIP files. Other than these, numerous ZIP file extractor apps are available at the Play Store that support various archive file formats. You can download and use any of the following apps on Android phones and tablets to create or extract ZIP files. ZArchiver ZArchiver is an archive controlling app using which you can create and extract archive files. This app supports many archive formats, including 7z (7zip), zip, bzip2 (bz2), gzip (gz), XZ, lz4, tar, and zst (zstd) files. You can also unzip and view 20+ different archive formats. ZArchiver also lets your device password-protect and edit archives (add or remove files). Other features offered by this app are: open compressed files, open archives from mail applications, and extract split archives. RAR by RARLAB RAR is a popular ZIP tool for Android devices that lets you create and extract ZIP files. It also opens 7z, TAR, XZ, GZ, ISO, BZ2 and ARJ files. The RAR zip tool is published by RARLAB, which also published the most popular online zip tool, WinRAR. However, RAR is not free, and you get ads while using the app. If you wish to remove ads from it, you have to pay for it. The payment is not a one-time payment. You have to pay $0.99 per year to renew your services. Solid Explorer Solid Explorer is an archive file management app which fulfils the basic requirement to manage archive files. This app supports various archive formats such as ZIP, RAR, TAR, and 7ZIP files. If you even uninstall (remove) the Solid Explorer from your device, the files you extracted or compressed remain on your phone or tablet, and they are even protected. Launch the Solid Explorer file manager on your device. Locate the zipped file in the app that you wish. Click on the file, and you will see the contents available or long-press to extract the zip file. Select the location to save your extracted files and follow the instructions. How to Compress Files into a ZIP on Android device If you wish to share a large number of files to others and also wish to speed up its processes, you have to compress files first. Compressing files together minimizes their size in a bundle. There are various archive management apps at the Play Store that lets you do the job easily. One such app is ZArchiver. Download and install the ZArchiver app from Google Play Store. When the installation gets complete, open the app and navigate to the folder containing files you want to compress. On the upper-right corner of the screen, click on the menu icon to view options. From the list of available options, tap on Create. Now, tap on the New archive to proceed. Input the name of your ZIP file, select the format (.zip, .rar, .rar4, etc.) and compression level. Once you fill in the details, tap on OK. After clicking on the OK option, you need to select the files you want to compress in ZIP. After selecting the files, tap on the green button present at the bottom-right corner of screen to enable and create a ZIP folder. Next Topic How to Block Unknown Numbers on Android ? prev next ?
