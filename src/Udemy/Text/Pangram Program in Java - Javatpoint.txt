            Pangram Program in Java In this section, we will discuss what is a pangram string. We will also create a Java program to check the given string is a pangram or not. What is pangram string? The string is called a pangram if it contains all the alphabets from a to z or A to Z, ignoring the case sensitivity. Example of Pangram Strings or Sentences The following string/ sentences are pangram strings: 
            
            Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. 
            The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
            My ex pub quiz crowd gave joyful thanks. 
            Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. 
            Fix problem quickly with galvanized jets. 
            Algorithm 
            
            Create a hash table (boolean vector). To mark the characters, present in the string. 
            Traverse over all the characters in the given string. 
            If the uppercase letter is found, subtract 'A' to find the index. 
            If the lowercase letter is found, subtract 'a' to find the index. 
            Mark the value in the vector as true (character found). 
            Return false if any character is unmarked (a character not found). 
            Else, return true. 
            Pangram Java Program In order to find the pangram string, there are the following two approaches: 
            
            Using Frequency Array 
            Using Traversal 
            Using Frequency Array 
            
            Convert each letter either in lowercase or in uppercase. 
            Create an array to mark the frequency of each alphabet (from a to z) of the given string. 
            Traverse over the frequency array. If there is any alphabet that is not present in the frequency array, print "the string is not a pangram string", else print "the string is a pangram string". 
            Let's implement the above approach in a Java program. PangramStringExample1.java 
           
            
public class PangramStringExample1 
{
static int size = 26;
//function to check if character is a letter or not
static boolean isLetter(char ch)
{
if (!Character.isLetter(ch))
//returns false if character is not a letter 
return false;
//returns true if character is a letter 
return true;
}
//function to check all the letters (a to z) are presented in the given string or not
static boolean containsAllLetters(String str, int len)
{
//converts the given string into lowercase
str = str.toLowerCase();
//creating a boolean array that stores the presence of letters
boolean[] present = new boolean[size];
//loop traverse over each character of the string
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) 
{
//checks if the current character is a letter
if (isLetter(str.charAt(i))) 
{
int letter = str.charAt(i) - 'a';
//marks the current letter as present
present[letter] = true;
}
}
//loop iterate over every letter of the given string 
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) 
{
if (!present[i])
//returns false if the current character is not presented in the string
return false;
}
//returns true if the current character is presented in the string
return true;
}
//driver Code
public static void main(String args[])
{
//string to check
String str = "Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
//determines the length of the given string
int len = str.length();
//function calling
if (containsAllLetters(str, len))
System.out.println("The given string is a pangram string.");
else
System.out.println("The given string is not a pangram string.");
}
}

            Output: 
           
            The given string is a pangram string.

            Using Traversal In this approach, first, convert all the letters into lowercase letters. After that, traverse over each character from a to z itself. Check if the given string contains all the letters (a to z), if present, print string id pangram, else print string is not pangram. Let's implement the above approach in a Java program. PangramStringExample2.java 
           
            
public class PangramStringExample2
{
//function to check if a string contains all the letters (a to z)
public static void containAllLetters(String string)
{
//converts the given string to lowercase
string = string.toLowerCase();
boolean allLetterPresent = true;
//loop iterate over each character of the given string
for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) 
{
//checks if the string does not contains all the letters
if (!string.contains(String.valueOf(ch))) 
{
allLetterPresent = false;
break;
}
}
//checks if all the letters are presented or not
if (allLetterPresent)
//if present, prints pangram
System.out.println("Pangram String");
else
//if present, prints not pangram
System.out.println("Not a Pangram String");
}
//driver code
public static void main(String args[])
{
//string to check
String string = "Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12";
//function calling
containAllLetters(string);
}
}

            Output: 
           
            Pangram String

            Let's see another approach. In this approach, we have created a Boolean type array named mark[]. Iterate over all the alphabets presented in the string and mark each visited alphabet. Suppose, a or A is found in the string, marked it at index 0. Similarly, for other alphabets. PangramStringExample3.java 
           
            
public class PangramStringExample3
{
//function checks whether the string is a pangram or not
public static boolean isPangram(String string)
{
//creating a boolean array to mark the character presented in the string
//by default all chracters are set to false
boolean[] mark = new boolean[26];
//for indexing in mark[]
int index = 0;
//loop iterate over all the characters
for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) 
{
//in case of uppercase letter subtract 'A' to find the index 
if ('A' <= string.charAt(i) && string.charAt(i) <= 'Z') 
index = string.charAt(i) - 'A';
//in case of lowercase letter subtract 'a' to find the index 
else if ('a' <= string.charAt(i) && string.charAt(i) <= 'z')
index = string.charAt(i) - 'a';
//if character is other than alphabet
else
continue;
mark[index] = true;
}
//return false if any character is unmarked
for (int i = 0; i <= 25; i++)
if (mark[i] == false)
return (false);
//if all characters were present
return (true);
}
//driver code
public static void main(String args[])
{
String string = "Fix problem quickly with galvanized jets";
if (isPangram(string) == true)
System.out.print(string + " is a pangram string.");
else
System.out.print(string + " is not a pangram string.");
}
} 

            Output: 
           
            Fix problem quickly with galvanized jets is a pangram string.

            Let's see another logic for the same. PangramStringExample4.java 
           
            
import java.util.Scanner;
public class PangramStringExample4
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the string: ");
//reads a string from the user
String str = sc.nextLine();
//determines the length of the string
int n=str.length();
int freq[] = new int[26];
//loop iterate over all the characters 
for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
{
//initially, each character marked with index 0     
freq[i]=0;
}  //end of for loop
//loop iterate over the given string
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
if(str.charAt(i)!=' ')
{
//subtract 'a' from the character at the specified index and increment the freqency index by 1
//means that chracter is marked
freq[str.charAt(i)-'a']++;
}  //end of if
}  //end of for loop
int temp=0;
for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
{
//if frequency index is 0, means character is unmarked    
if(freq[i]==0)
{
//set temp to 1 and break the loop    
temp=1;
break;
}
}  //end of for loop
//if condition is true, the string is pangram string, else not pangram
if(temp==1)
{
System.out.println("The string is not a pangram string.");
}
else
{
System.out.println("The string is a pangram string.");
}
}
}

            Output: 
           
            Enter the string: pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
The string is a pangram string.

            Complexity Time Complexity: Its time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Space Complexity: Its space complexity is O(1) because it does not require extra space.
