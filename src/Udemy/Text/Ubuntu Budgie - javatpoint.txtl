It incorporates the thoroughly-tested and stable Ubuntu Core along with a traditional-looking, lightweight, and modern desktop integrated by the Solus project. The current version of Ubuntu budgie is 21.10 which was released in 2021 on 14 October. History of Ubuntu budgie Ubuntu budgie version began as a flavor of an unofficial community in parallel with the 16.04 LTS release of Ubuntu which is known as budgie-remix. The 16.10 version of budgie-remix was later published by strictly pursuing the time frame which was an issue for the 16.10 version of Ubuntu. Eventually, it was identified as a flavor of an official community of Ubuntu and it was renamed Ubuntu Budgie. The 17.04 version of Ubuntu Budgie was published in 2017 April and it was updated to the 17.10 version in 2017 October. In the 18.10 version of Ubuntu Budgie, the support for 32-bit has been dropped. The support for 32-bit has been dropped in the Ubuntu MATE flavor as well. Vincenzo Bovino was worked as the PR and new brand manager. Releases of Ubuntu budgie Budgie remix 16.04 The 16.04 version of budgie-remix was published in 2016 on 25 April, 4 days after the publication of the 16.04 version of Ubuntu. The system includes the 10.2.5 version of Budgie Desktop. It has a window manager which is based on Mutter, notification center settings, a customizable panel. The theme, i.e., Arc-GTK+ is used in this release. Budgie-remix has the 3.18 version of Nautilus, as at the time Ubuntu OS had the 3.14 version of Nautilus as compared to the 16.04 version of Ubuntu. It also includes the 0.11.1 version of dock panel Plank, the 3.18 version of gedit, the 3.18 version of GNOME photos, the 3.4.3 version of gThumb, the 3.3 version of Rhythmbox, the 3.18 version of Totem, the 3.18 version of GNOME Terminal, the 5.1.2 version of LibreOffice, the 45.0 version of Mozilla Firefox, the 2.84 version of Transmission, the 3.18.9 version of GTK+, the 11.2.0 version of Mesa, the 1.18.3 version of XOrg, and the 4.4.0 version of Linux kernel. Budgie remix 16.10 The 16.10 version of budget-remix was published in 2016 on 16 October, three days after the publication of the 16.10 version of Ubuntu. The system includes the 10.2.7 version of a shell Budgie Desktop, the 3.22 version of GTK+, and the 4.8 version of Linux kernel. There are various new aspects that are implemented in this release such as support for more than one language at the time of the installation, home folder encryption, and full disk encryption. Also, it includes the Arc GTK+ design theme and a fresh Pocillo theme icon. David Mohammed (one of the budgie-remix developers) says: "This is our first release that follows the release cycle of Ubuntu - we worked to closely link our alpha and two beta versions in the same way as Ubuntu and other official communities. Based on the impressions of 16.04.1, the feedback and suggestions we received from our users, the new release comes with many new features, fixes, and optimization." Ubuntu budgie 17.04 The 17.04 version of Ubuntu budgie was published in 2017 on 19 April. Budgie-remix was rebranded to this term after the sharing became official for the community of Ubuntu. The system includes the 10.2.9 version of Budgie Desktop shell, the 4.10 version of the Linux kernel, the 17.0.3 version of Mesa, and the 1.19.3 version of Xorg. The application, i.e., Budgie-Welcome was updated and support for the indicator of the application appeared, all sound applets were handled, the 3.24 GNOME applications were activated, GNOME Terminal was substituted with Termix, and Google Chrome was replaced with Chromium, and support of GTK+ theme for Qt was activated. It applies the Arc GTK+ design theme and the theme Moka icons. In the record of the publication of this version, it was specified below: "A significant part of this development cycle was spent on integration with the Canonical assembly system. The key visible integration elements were the Plymouth settings, which used Ubiquity installer, processing packages to remove the identities of "budgie-remix" and replaced with the renewed identity of "Ubuntu Budgie"." Ubuntu Budgie 17.10 The 17.10 version of Ubuntu Budgie was published in 2017 on 19 October. The system includes the 10.4 version of Budgie Desktop shell and the 4.3 version of the Linux kernel.

In addition, there is also support for the panels of the right side or left side in the 10.4 version of Budgie Desktop, support to convert panels in a dock, dynamic and transparency auto-image for every panel, and the capability for replenishing the bottom panel to implement without a "jump" effect. Other improvements in the publication of the 17.10 version of Ubuntu Budgie contain Caffeine and Night Light tools, Tilix as the terminal emulator (default) rather than Termix, and support for the mode of Tilix Quake along with the F12 key as well. Also, it has new wallpapers and updated icons of the panel. Canonical withdrew the 17.10 distribution of Ubuntu in October and hide the link over the site to download in 2017 on 20 December. The reason was a typical bug with the damage of BIOS on a few models of the Lenovo notebook and one model of Acer.

The latest release of Ubuntu Budgie The 21.10 version of Ubuntu Budgie is a general version that would be supported for nine months until 2022 July. Long-term Releases like 20.04.3 facilitate stability on a longer-term (three years) as compared to the standard nine months release. Stability and critical fixes will be published for every supported component of Ubuntu Budgie. These would be initiated by ourselves, the wider Ubuntu community, and Canonical. Some areas that are covered in this release note are as follows: Enhancements and new features Upgrading from the 20.04.3 or 21.04 version of Ubuntu Budgie Where to install Ubuntu Budgie Known problems when upgrading Mini apps and applets Summary of modifications: Several updated translations from many brilliant translators Fix to spam the Syslog if previews were enabled but the end-users were logged into the session of a Wayland desktop Fix for the layouts of the Window Shuffler runnable installation path for working on stateless distributions The Window Shuffler Control option has been completely redesigned and revamped. Now, Window Shuffler contains an applet for re-arranging and automatically moving Windows, either one window or a set of windows. Now, Shuffler also contains Window Rules. The rules of the Shuffler Window permit us to open the application windows on particular workspaces. The Calculator of Applications Menu now displays a visual hint to copy the output to the layout. Transition through the modes of Grid to List of the Applications Menu is now disappear instead of a slide animation. A few themes oddly space the list of the category. Now, we have the user-configurable override inside the settings of the applet permitting us to manage the spacing. We no more install the schema of the elementary gsettings. It ensures that we do not clash with the pantheon install. Now, the entry of the elementary schema is detected in a schema of the budgie applications. Changes in the Budgie Calendar Applet: Manage correctly the appearance of AM/PM if using custom formats of the date. It also backported to the 20.04 or 20.10 version.

Now, we show a hint if we open the popover and scrolling on the icon of the panel modifies the workspace. Now, Brightness Controller has been re-implemented for using dbus control of GNOME. Hence, it should be distribution friendly and it will reflect a similar Power slider within GNOME settings. Desktop of Budgie The 10.5.3 version of Budgie is a minor publication that defines all fixes for many bugs, several quality-of-life developments, and also support for GNOME 40 stack. Fixes and Cleanup of Bug The 10.5.3 version of Budgie defines many solutions for Budgie panel applets, several Window state tracking, and Raven. Drop Queue use and cancelable in the NotificationView of Raven. Rather than using any Queue (which is anyways not thread-safe), only update the reference to the NotificationWindow since we are just concerned about the Queue head to start with. Discarded Cancellable Usage for the scaling of async pixbuf. There has not been any scenario yet in which we haven't been able for scaling the icon in the time amount before a NotificationWindow is deleted. Fix the icons of the application not scaling in the Notification Group Header of Raven. Fix problems with the icon of VirtualBox not being shown in the applet, i.e., IconTaskList. Fix regression in the icon, i.e., Budgie Desktop Settings managing. Now, CanGoNext/CanGoPrevious, playback status, and MPRIS metadata are performed immediately instead of being an unnecessary operation. Now, notifications apply a high priority timeout. Now, notification iconography applies a steady IconSize.DIALOG rather than IconSize.INVALID and just scales when the icon given is not already the wanted height. Sound indicator Raven and applet Use standard unmute and mute methods, fixing problems such as muting using media keys and trying to unmute by the applet which will not work previously.

Add the command line option, i.e., --force-model modelname. Add the command line option, i.e., --model modelname -cpuinfo "CPU String to Match". Enhanced the discoverability of several options by using applying a mouse hover and showing a hint inside a 'status area'. Disable buttons and facilitate hint on the tab, i.e., Overclock when no '/boot/firmware/config.txt'. Disable buttons and give hint on the tab, i.e., Display when pibootctl is not detected. Themes Snap has been generated for Pocillo and QogirBudgie GTK themes. It means now we can theme snap that is themable.

It is helpful in decreasing distractions if watching or gaming content. The Lock Keys applet could be pressed to toggle NumLock and CapsLock if xdotool is present on the operating system. Additional Now, Nemo Previews are available as a suggestion application in the Budgie Welcome to permit us for visualizing the content of any highlighted file.

Simply, we will need to execute a command for the installation process. Step 1: We need to press the shortcut keys, i.e., Ctrl+Alt+T for launching the terminal. After that, we will enter the below command in our terminal to see the updates: 
$ sudo apt update
