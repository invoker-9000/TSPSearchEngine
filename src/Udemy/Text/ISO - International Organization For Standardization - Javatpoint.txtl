If the product has an ISO mark, then the customers will have confidence that the product they are using is good and beneficial for them. Registration process: The steps to get an ISO certificate are as under: Step 1: New standard is proposed to the relevant technical committee. Then, the further steps happen if the proposal is accepted; otherwise, the registration process willstop here. Step 2: Working group of experts start the discussion to prepare a working draft. Step 3: First working draft shared with the technical committee and with ISO central secretariat. Step 4: If consensus is reached within the technical committee, then draft shared with all ISO national members who are asked to comment. Step 5: If consensus is reached then the final draft is sent to all ISO members. Step 6: If standards are approved by member vote, then it is included in ISO international standard. The registration process for the organization: Step 1: Select the ISO standard as per your business need. Step 2: Prepare the documents for ISO standards. Step 3: Select the certification body from where you want to obtain the certificate. Step 4: Fill the application form of the certification body. Step 5: ISO auditors verify the documents provided by users. Step 6: If the documents are correct, then the registrar will observe the important quality operations. Step 7: If the quality is up to the mark, then the ISO inspector does a physical inspection by visiting the organization. Step 8: The inspector is satisfied if the organization follows all standards and the organization is following the quality process.
