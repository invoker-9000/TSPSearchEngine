            Magic Number in C In this section, we will discuss magic numbers in C programming language along with their various examples. When the sum of all the given digits of a number and the reverse of that sum is multiplied, which is equal to the original number, and then the number is called a magic number. For example, suppose we have a 1729 number and we need to validate whether the number is a magic number or not. So, first we need to get the sum of all digits of the number which is 19 (1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19). Reverse the sum of the number is 91, and then get the product of the sum of original digits with the reverse of that sum as 19 * 19 = 1729. So, it is the magic number. Steps to find the Magic number in C Step 1: Declare an integer type variable and input a number from the user to store it in N. Step 2: Get the sum of all digits of the original number and store it another variable A. Step 3: Reverse the number of variable A and store into B. Step 4: After that, multiply the values of variable A and B and store into C. Step 5: Check whether C == N, then the number is a Magic Number. Else, the Number is not a Magic number. Example 1: Program to check whether the number is a Magic number in C Let's create a program to take a number from the user and validate whether the entered number is a magic number or not in the C programming language. 
           
            
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main ()
{
	// declare integer variables
	int n, temp, rev = 0, digit, sum_of_digits = 0;
	
	printf (" Enter a Number: \n");
	scanf (" %d", &n); // get the number
	
	temp = n; // assign the number to temp variable
	
	// use while loop to calculate the sum of digits
	while ( temp > 0)
	{
		// extract digit one by one and store into the sum_of_digits
		sum_of_digits = sum_of_digits + temp % 10; /* use modulus symbol to get the remainder of each iteration by temp % 10 */
		temp = temp / 10;
	}
	
	temp = sum_of_digits; // assign the sum_of_digits to temp variable
	printf (" \n The sum of the digits = %d", temp);
	
	// get the reverse sum of given digits
	while ( temp > 0)
	{
		rev = rev * 10 + temp % 10;
		temp = temp / 10;
	}
	
	printf (" \n The reverse of the digits = %d", rev);
	
	
	printf (" \n The product of %d * %d = %d", sum_of_digits, rev, rev * sum_of_digits);
	// use if else statement to check the magic number
	if ( rev * sum_of_digits == n)
	{
		printf (" \n %d is a Magic Number. ", n);
	}
	else
	{
		printf (" \n %d is not a Magic Number. ", n);
	}
	return 0;
	
}

            When we execute the above program in the C compiler, it produces the below output in the console screen. 
           
            Enter a number
1729
The sum of the digits = 19
The reverse of the digits = 91
The product of 19 * 91 = 1729 
1729 is a Magic Number.

            In the above program, we take 1729 from the user and assign the number to the temp variable. After that, use a while loop to extract the sum of the original digits (n) into sum_of_digits one by one and assign the result to the temp. Use the loop again to reverse the sum of the digits and print the reverse number. And finally compare the original digit (N) with the multiplication of sum_of_digits and rev variable that return the same result to show a magic number. Example 2: Program to check whether the number is a Magic number using the user-defined function Let's create an example to take a number from the user and validate whether the entered number is a magic number or not in the C programming language. 
           
            
/* program to check the magic number using the user-defined function in c programming. */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

// create getReverse () function to get the reverse of the given number
int getReverse (int num)
{
	int revNum = 0;
	
	//use while loop to get the reverse of original nummber (n)
	while ( num > 0)
	{
		revNum = (revNum * 10) + (num % 10);
		num = num / 10;	
	 } 
	 printf (" \n The reverse of the number = %d", revNum);
	 return revNum;
}

// create getSum() function to get the sum of each digits of the given number
int getSum ( int num)
{
	int sum = 0; // initialize the sum variable with 0
	while ( num > 0)
	{
		sum = sum + ( num % 10);
		num = num / 10;
	}
	printf ( " \n The sum of the given number = %d", sum);
	return sum;
}

int main ()
{
	// declare variable
	int num, sum, revNum;
	printf (" Enter the number: ");
	scanf (" %d", &num);
	
	sum = getSum (num); // call getSum () function
	revNum = getReverse (sum); // callgetReverse () function and argument sum
	
	int result = sum * revNum;
	printf (" \n The product of %d and %d = %d ", sum, revNum, result);
	
	// use if else to check condition
	if (sum * revNum == num)
	{
		printf (" \n %d is a magic number. ", num);	
	}
	else
	{
		printf ( " \n %d is not a magic number. ", num);
	}
}

            When we execute the above program in the C compiler, it produces the below output in your computer screen. 
           
            Enter the number: 1729
The sum of the given number = 19
The reverse of the number = 91
The product of 19 and 91 = 1729
1729 is a Magic Number.

            2nd execution: 
           
            Enter the number: 5189
The sum of the given number = 23
The reverse of the number = 32
The product of 23 and 32 = 736
5189 is not a magic number.

            In the above program, we take 5189 from the user and create two user defined function getSum() and getRevere(). Where the getSum() function is used to calculate the sum of the given number, and the getReverse() function to reverse sum of the getSum() function. If the multiplication of the getSum() and getReverse()function is equal to the num, the number is a magic number. Method 2: Recursive Method to check the Magic number in C A number is said to be a magic number, if the sum of the digits is recursively calculated till a single digit which is equal to 1. Otherwise the number is not a magic number Example 1: Program to find the Magic number using recursive Method Let's create a program to input the integer data from the user and validate whether the number is a magic number or not in the C programming language. 
           
            
/* create a program to get the magic number by dividing the given number by 9. */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
int main ()
{
	// declare integer variable
	int num;
	printf ( " Enter the number: ");
	scanf (" %d", &num);
	
	// get the modulus of the input number by 9 to check magic number
	if ( num % 9 == 1)
	{
		printf ( " It is a Magic Number. ");
	}
	else
	{
		printf ( " it is not a Magic Number. ");
	}
	return 0;
}

            When we execute the above program in the C compiler, it produces the below output in the console screen. 
           
            Enter the number: 1789
It is a Magic Number.

            2nd execution: 
           
            Enter the number: 55057
It is not a Magic Number.
