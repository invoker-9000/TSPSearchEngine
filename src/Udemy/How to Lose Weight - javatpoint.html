           </div> <h1 class="h1">How to lose weight</h1> <p>Only relying either on exercises, diet plans or on medicines can't help you lose weight. A balanced approach is needed to smartly lose weight! You don't need to eat less, run more, take the extra burden of managing calorie intake and overlook your hunger. Just follow the below listed tips to transform yourself.</p> <h2 class="h2">1) Morning walk</h2> <p>Morning walk is believed to be an ideal aerobic activity that helps burn calories and build muscles. According to fitness experts, a 30-minute morning walk can burn 150-250 calories. Also, it improves blood circulation and keeps you active throughout the day, living actively means burning more calories. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/jogging.jpg" alt="morning walk"> <h2 class="h2">2) Drink sufficient water</h2> Drink plenty of fruit juices of your choice at breakfast but during rest of the day instead of drinking juices or soda keep your focus on water. It will protect you from excessive calorie intake because of intake of sugary drinks.<p></p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/drink_water.jpg" alt="drink water"> <h2 class="h2">3) Include exercise in your daily routine</h2> <p>Exercise is usually the first thing that comes in our mind when we think of losing weight. Nothing wrong in it, definitely, exercise is a proven way of not only losing weight but also to acquire a lean and fit body. Running, dancing, walking and yoga all are different forms of exercise on which you can rely on to lose weight. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/exercise.jpg" alt="exercise daily"> <h2 class="h2">4) Increase intake of vegetable</h2> <p>Vegetables are believed to be the best part of your diet that promotes weight loss.

We don't gain weight because of eating but we gain because we eat more than what is actually needed by our body. So avoid the habits like eating while watching T.V and whenever you are stressed as people tend to eat more when they are stressed, drink plenty of water under such circumstances. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/wrong_eating.jpg" alt="wrong eating"> <h2 class="h2">6) Reduce or avoid beer intake</h2> <p>Beer is found to have easily digested carbs that slow down breakdown of body fat. You can replace it with other alcoholic options that also promote weight loss such as Red Wine, Dry champagne and pure spirits like vodka and whiskey.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/avoid-beer.jpg" alt="avoid beer"> <h2 class="h2">7) Avoid artificial sweeteners</h2> <p>Many researchers have failed to establish any connection between weight loss and replacing intake of plain sugar with artificial sweeteners. On the contrary, scientific studies say that artificial sweeteners promote appetite and desire for sweet meal.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/artificial-sweeteners.jpg" alt="avoid artificial sweeteners"> <h2 class="h2">8) Eat yogurt daily</h2> <p>According to researches, the high protein content of yogurt makes it a great snack for weight loss. Its intake doesn't let you feel starved even few hours after your meal. Also, the bacteria in yogurt are very beneficial for maintaining gut flora that promotes digestion and breakdown of excessive body fat. Eventually, it improves the digestion that reduces the rate of fat deposition in our body.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/yogurt.jpg" alt="eat yogurt"> <h2 class="h2">9) Eat Apple</h2> <p>Apple is not only full of pulp and nectar but also of medicinal properties that can promote weight loss.

Whenever, you eat it between meals or while watching T.V you are loading yourself with unwanted calories. So, instantly reduce or stop their intake to gain ideal body weight.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/eat-less-chips.jpg" alt="eat less chips"> <h2 class="h2">12) Practice yoga</h2> <p>Yoga is a wonderful practice to create harmony between mind and body.

Most of us tend to find out something to eat whenever we are stressed, bored or even happy. So we should be smart enough to find out that the desire to eat is arising out of hunger or emotions. And, be focused on eating only when you are hungry and want to satisfy your hunger. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/stop_emotional-eating.jpg" alt="stop emotional eating"> <h2 class="h2">14) Walk up and down the stair </h2> <p>This activity can be easily included in our daily routine. We should not miss the chance to walk up the stair. Like aerobic exercises, it helps burn calories instantly. According to researchers, by waking up the stair, we can burn 5-9 calories in a minute. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/walking_up_stairs.jpg" alt="walk up and down the stair "> <h2 class="h2">15) Focus on low-carb diet</h2> <p>You should eat only a natural and unprocessed low-carb meal. It has been found in various researches that a low-carb diet is more effective than low-fat diet for weight loss. For a low-carb diet you must prefer fish, eggs, meat, fruits, vegetables, healthy oils, nuts and seed over wheat, sugar and trans fats.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/low_carb_diet.jpg" alt="take low carb diet"> <h2 class="h2">16) Walk before dinner</h2> <p>According to a recent study, a 20-minute walk before dinner can reduce appetite and give the filling of fullness just like you feel after a light meal. It means after a 20-minute walk you don't need to fight yourself to eat in limits. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/walk.jpg" alt="walk before dinner"> <h2 class="h2">17) Green tea</h2> <p>Green tea thermogenic property make it an ideal tea for weight-loss. Its thermogenic effect heats up our metabolism and it starts burning calories at faster rate. It also attacks the calories stored as fat under the tissues. So, prefer green tea over other beverages for healthy weight loss. </p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/green_tea.jpg" alt="green tea"> <h2 class="h2">18) Use pedometer while walking</h2> <p>Pedometer is a small tool that counts your steps, distance travelled, speed as well as the calories burned while walking. When you walk with a pedometer you can easily evaluate your daily progress. Its use motivates you to walk more and more. Various researches have shown that pedometer users walk more steps than nonusers in a day. More walking means burning more calories!</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/use_pedometer.jpg" alt="use pedometer"> <h2 class="h2">19) Get sufficient sleep</h2> <p>Don't reduce your sleeping hours. An adequate sleep is liked with many physiological changes that help lose weight in a healthy way. A sound sleep reduces the chances of late-night snacking. Also, it keeps our metabolism and us active across the day that burns more fat and calories as compared to sleep-deprived people.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/health/weight/images/sleep2.jpg" alt="get sufficient sleep"> <h2 class="h2">20) Don't be idle at home</h2> <p>Be active at weekends at home. Engage yourself in some rigorous housework like washing car, windows, dusting furniture and mopping the floor. Gardening is also a good option of housework to burn calories. The more rigorous your housework the more calories you can burn.
