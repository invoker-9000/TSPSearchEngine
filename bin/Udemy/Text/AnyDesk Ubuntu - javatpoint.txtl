The normal scam process is below: fraudsters will get victims for downloading AnyDesk software on the mobile phone using the Google Play Store, by usually mimicking the legitimate company customer service. After that, the scammers will convince those victims for providing the access code of nine-digit and for granting several permissions. Usually, the scammers send money with the help of the Indian Unified Payment Interface after several permissions are granted and when no other measures of security are in position. The same scam has taken place according to the Kashmir Cyber police in 2020. Bundling using ransomware Trend Micro (a Japanese cyber security firm) discovered in 2018 May that many cybercriminals wrapped a new variant of ransomware using AnyDesk, as a masking of evasion tactic the actual purpose of ransomware at the time of it performs the routine of encryption. Technical support scams Several scammers have been familiar with using AnyDesk and the same software of the remote desktop for obtaining complete access to the computer of the victim by impersonating the technical support person. Then, the victim is prompted for downloading and installing AnyDesk and providing the attackers with full access. The attackers could control the system and move sensitive data and personal files if access is obtained. Why do we need AnyDesk? There are several reasons where we need AnyDesk.
