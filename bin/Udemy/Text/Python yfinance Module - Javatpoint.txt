            Python yfinance Module There are many instances when we have to get financial data or statements of a blogging site or even a browser sometimes. One of the famous browsers that allow us to collect its financial data is Yahoo, and actually, there are many instances when we need to perform this task. In this tutorial, we are going to learn about the yfinance module in Python, and we will learn how we can get financial data from Yahoo using this module and what kind of data we can collect from it. yfinance Module in Python The yfinance is one of the famous modules in Python, which is used to collect online data, and with it, we can collect the financial data of Yahoo. With the help of the yfinance module, we retrieve and collect the company's financial information (such as financial ratios, etc.) as well as the histories of marketing data by using its functions. But, before we start learning more about this module and its implementation as well as applications, we have to install the yfinance module in our system (as it is not a built-in module in Python). Once the installation process is done, we will proceed to the implementation part of the yfinance module. Installation In this section, we will learn how we can install the yfinance module in our system so that we can import it into a program and use its functions. We have to follow the following steps to install the yfinance module on our device: Step 1: Open the command prompt terminal of the device and locate the directory (using mkdir) where Python is installed in the system. Step 2: Now write the following command in the terminal to install the yfinance module with pip installer: 
           
            
pip install yfinance

              Step 3: When we will press the enter key, the pip installer will start installing the yfinance module in the system at the defined path.  As we can see, the yfinance module is successfully installed in our system, and now we can start working with it by importing it into a Python program. Implementation Now, we will use the yfinance module in our Python program so that we can collect the financial data from Yahoo using it and understand its implementation. When we are using the yfinance module in our program, we have to pass the ticker as an argument inside the function (Here, Ticker is referred to as the ticker of a company). 
            
            Note: A ticker is basically a stock symbol or unique series of alphabets for the company names, and it is assigned to add an extra security layer for trading purposes. Look at the following examples of tickers that we will use in the yfinance module: 
             
             Ticker for Google is "GOOGL" 
             The ticker for Facebook is "FB" 
             and, Ticker for Amazon is "AMZN", etc. 
             
            Now, let's use the yfinance module in various example programs so that we can understand its function and implementation easily. Look at the following example programs using the yfinance module in them for collecting data: Example 1: Look at the following Python program where we will retrieve the financial data of Facebook from Yahoo finance: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module in the program
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Printing Facebook financial information in the output
print(retrFBInfo.info)

            Output:

            Explanation: We have firstly imported the yfinance module as yahooFin in the program to use its functionality. Then, we have used the yahooFin with the FB Ticker function to collect all the financial information of the Facebook page from Yahoo. After retrieving the financial information from the Facebook page of Yahoo, we have printed this information in the output when the program is executed. As we can see in the output, we have printed all the financial data as a whole Python dictionary. Collecting Financial Key Metrics from Yahoo: Other than retrieving the financial information from Yahoo sites (as we have performed in example 1), we can even collect various financial key metrics. These financial key metrics can be Price Earnings Ratio, Company Beta and Company Sector etc., from the whole Python dictionary that we printed in the above first example. Let's retrieve the financial key metrics by using the yfinance module. Example 2: Look at the following Python program where we will retrieve the financial key metrics from the Yahoo using yfinance module: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Getting Key metrics from the Facebook financial data we retrieved
comSecKey = retrFBInfo.info['sector'] # Company Sector key
keyPER = retrFBInfo.info['trailinPE'] # Price Earning ratio key
comBetaKey = retrFBInfo.info['beta'] # Company Beta key
# Print the Company Sector Information
print("The Company Sector Metric key we collected from the page: ", comSecKey)
# Print the Price Earnings Ratio (PER) from the FB page
print("The Price Earnings Ratio (PER) we got from the financial data of page: ", keyPER)
# Print the Company Beta metric from page
print("The Company Beta key we retrieved from page: ", comBetaKey)

            Output: 
           
            The Company Sector Metric key we collected from the page:  Communication Services
The Price Earnings Ratio (PER) we got from the financial data of page:  26.211199
The Company Beta key we retrieved from page:  1.295305

            Explanation: Instead of retrieving complete financial data information from the page, we have retrieved only a limited set of financial key metrics in this program. We have firstly initialized three variables (keyPer, comSecKey and comBetaKey) and stored the values of financial key metrics from the financial data we have collected from the Facebook page. We have retrieved Price Earning Ratio, Company Beta and Company Sector financial metric keys in this example and stored them in the respective variable. After storing the financial metric keys, we have printed them in the output as a result, and as we can see in the output, details are successfully printed. Splitting the financial metric keys: In the first and second examples, we have printed the financial data and metric keys from Yahoo as they are some dictionary values. But we can even split these values by means of key-value pair, and then we can print the split result. In the following example, we will print the financial metric keys values by splitting them, and we will split them by looping over them. Example 3: Look at the following Python program, where we will split the financial metric keys into key-value pairs: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Looping over items to split them in key-value pair
print("Items from the financial data of the Facebook page in the key-value page: ")
for keyItem, valueItem in retrFBInfo.info.items():
    print(keyItem, ":", valueItem)    

            Output: 
           
            Items from the financial data of the Facebook page in the key-value page:

            Explanation: After retrieving information from the Facebook financial data from Yahoo, we have used for loop on it. With the help of for loop, we have looped over the data, and then we split the data items into key-value pairs. In last, we have printed these key-value pairs in the output as a result of the program. Retrieving Historical Market Prices: We can even retrieve the historical market prices from Yahoo financial data, and then we can even print this information in the output. Example 4: Let's first look at the following example, and then we will understand more about retrieving historical market prices: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Initializing variable for retrieving market prices
maxHisMP = retrFBInfo.history(period="max")
# Printing the historical market prices in the output
print("Historical Market Prices data from the Facebook page financial data of Yahoo: ")
print(maxHisMP)

            Output: 
           
            Historical Market Prices data from the Facebook page financial data of Yahoo:

            Explanation: In this example, we have imported the historical market prices from Facebook's financial data from the Yahoo page we retrieved in the program. We have retrieved the historical market prices from Facebook's financial data using the history() function with the FB Ticker, and then we have stored the information inside the variable we have initialized, i.e., maxHisMP. In last, we have printed this historical market prices information in the output as a result of the program. We can see the information regarding the history of market prices for the maximum period available in the Yahoo financial data. Note: The 'max' we have defined in the history function with the FB ticker is used to collect the history of market prices available for the maximum time period in Yahoo. The max keyword will retrieve the history of daily price changes for Facebook available in Yahoo. Now, we have learned that how we can bring the history of market prices from Yahoo's financial data using its history() function. But here is a thing that we can even minimize our data which we are getting from history() to reduce its complexity. We can do this by giving a fixed time argument inside the history() function and retrieve only a small amount of data from Yahoo. Here, we are going to perform this function in two ways which are following: 1. Collecting fixed time data since Last '1 day' or '5 day' or '1 month' or '3 month' etc., by providing fixed time argument inside the history function. Let's understand this by using the fixed time argument inside a program and then retrieving market prices from Yahoo. Example 5: Look at the following Python program where we will retrieve the last 3 month's history of market prices from Facebook: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Initializing variable for retrieving market prices
his3MonMP = retrFBInfo.history(period="3mo")
# Printing the historical market prices in the output
print("Historical Market Prices data of last 3 months from the Facebook page of Yahoo: ")
print(his3MonMP)

            Output: 
           
            Historical Market Prices data of last 3 months from the Facebook page of Yahoo: 
                  Open        High         Low       Close    Volume  \
Date

            Explanation: We have used the same logic as we have used in the previous example program and collected the data of historical market prices from the Facebook page of Yahoo. But, in this program, instead of collecting the maximum data, we have limited our data by giving the argument '3mo' inside the history function so that it will only retrieve the history of market prices for the last three months only. And then, we printed this last three months market prices history in the output as a result. As we can see in the output, the history of market prices of the Facebook page in Yahoo since only last three months have been printed. Note: When we have to collect the data from a past fixed time, then we cannot give any duration argument in the history function because it will not be a valid argument. We have the following valid fixed time period arguments for the history function of the yfinance module: max, ytd, 10y, 5y, 2y, 1y, 6mo, 3mo, 1mo, 5d and 1d. We cannot give any other time period argument inside the history() function as it will be treated as an invalid argument, and no data of market prices history will be retrieved. 2. Collecting fixed data from the history() function by giving start time and end time as the arguments of this history() function. We can retrieve the data of the time period which we want by defining starting and end time variables and then using these variables as the arguments of the history() function. Let's understand this by using these defined time arguments inside a program and then retrieving market prices history from Yahoo. Example 6: Look at the following Python program where we will retrieve history of market prices from Facebook for a user defined period of time: 
           
            
# Import yfinance module
import yfinance as yahooFin
# Importing datetime module in the program
import datetime
# Using ticker for the Facebook in yfinance function
retrFBInfo = yahooFin.Ticker("FB")
# Define a start date variable
strtDate = datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 26)
# Define an end date variable
endDate = datetime.datetime(2021, 8, 6)
# Initializing variable for retrieving market prices
fixTimeMP = retrFBInfo.history(start = strtDate, end = endDate)
# Printing the historical market prices in the output
print("Historical Market Prices data of the time period we defined from the financial data of Facebook page: ")
print(fixTimeMP)

            Output: 
           
            Historical Market Prices data of the time period we defined from the financial data of Facebook page: 
                  Open        High         Low       Close    Volume  \
Date

            Explanation: We have imported the yfinance as well as datetime module in this program so that we can use the datetime() function of it. Then, we defined two variables where we set start and end dates in them using the datetime function of the datetime module. Then, we used these variables inside the history() function as the start and end date of retrieving data from Yahoo. We have used the start and end keyword inside the history() to set the starting date and ending date for collecting the data. That's how we will retrieve a user fixed time's market prices history from Yahoo. In last, we have printed the minimized data in the output as a result. We can see in the output that we have got the fixed time (which we set in the program) history of market prices from Yahoo.
