Conference Call on Android A conference call is a telephonic call in which a person can talk to 3 (including the calling party) or even more people simultaneously. Conference calls are designed to allow the parties to participate during the call to share and listen to each other in a single call. A conference call can be done either by simple voice conferencing or video conference call. Nowadays, conference calls are important for everyone, including any team, on-site or remote people. Doing conference calls on an Android phone is simple; anyone can do this easily. You can make conference calls by only using the phone itself. To make a conference call, call up the first person and then merge others calls one by one using the merge option. Prepare yourself before making a conference call: Before making conference calls on a mobile phone, you should consider these points: The number of people in your call: You should consider using a hosting company or landline service if there are more than 5 people in your conference call. Many telecommunication software allows you to add up to 50 contacts on a single conference call. It is possible to use a landline: The landline services even provide better sound quality and often a more suitable environment to make a conference call, which is important during the formal call. Moreover, there is more software that allows landlines to support large-scale conference calls. Below we will discuss how to make a conference call on an Android phone.

Once the person whom you call picks up your call, tap on the “+" symbol with the name to Add call. Now once again, enter the second person’s number you want to add to your call.

Manners of the conference call (especially in a video call) As you prepare for a business meeting, it is important to present yourself professionally and formally during a conference call. Below is some point you should be kept in mind: Be prepared On the business conference call, you must be on time to attain the conference call. Make sure you are logged in, set up and ready to discuss topics before the scheduled time of the call. If you use a website or application for a conference call, test and ensure that everything is running well. Choose a silent location with a strong network signal Before starting the call, find a place that is free from noise and interference so that every participant is involved effectively. Besides this, the use of headphones can also eliminate unwanted outside noise. Also, ensure that your location catches strong and stable network signals. Make sure your phone is fully charged already: If possible, keep chargers and outlets close to you. Turn off your ringers: Make sure to remove any unnecessary interruptions by switching your smartphone and laptop to silent mode before making a call. Stay focused Most smartphones support multitasking and allow you to perform another job during your phone call. Instead, other participants cannot see you doing another task, but you have to present them effectively. Next Topic How to Delete all Emails at once on Android ? prev next ?
