            Print Matrix Diagonally in Java In this section, we will understand how to print a matrix in a diagonal order. Also, create a Java program that prints the matrix in a diagonal order. Diagonal Order First, we will understand the diagonal printing order. Consider the following matrix having 4 rows and 5 columns.  The diagonal pattern will be: 
           
            
0	      	  (first element of the first row and first column)
1 2	      	  (starts from the first element of the second row)
3 4 5	          (starts from the first element of the third row)
6 7 8 9	          (starts from the first element of the fourth row)
10 11 12 13	  (starts from the first element of the fifth row and the last element of the first column)
14 15 16	  (starts from the last element of the second column)
17 18	          (starts from the last element of the third column)
19	          (starts from the last element of the fourth column)

            From the above pattern, we observe that the diagonal 10 11 12 13 prints twice because 10 is the first element of the fifth row and the last element of the first column. It is common in both. Therefore, we can calculate the formula for the number of diagonals in a matrix, as m+n-1 (where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. -1 denotes a diagonal that is counted twice.). 
           
            
Number of diagonals in matrix= m+n-1

            Let's see the flow. Consider a matrix. In the following matrix, the first digit denotes the row number and the second digit denotes the column number.  Suppose, we have to print the diagonal elements of 20 11 02 (where 20 is the first element, 11 is the second element, and 02 is the third and last element of the diagonal).  We observe that each time when we find the next diagonal element i is decremented by 1 and j is incremented by 1. Hence, 
           
            
i=i-1
j=j+1

            Therefore, if we know the first element of the diagonal, we can find all the diagonal elements up to the end by using the above logic. Let's implement the above logic in a Java program. PrintMatrixDiagonal.java 
           
            
import java.io.*;
public class PrintMatrixDiagonal
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
int i, j, k, n=3, m=3;
//initializing a matrix  
int arr[][] = {{3, 7, 9}, {2, 1, 5}, {8, 6, 4}};  
System.out.println("Matrix elements in diagonal form are: ");
//for loop for diagonals that starts from the first elements of the rows
//variable k denotes the starting of the element in rows
//loop execute till m-1 i.e. if matrix is m*n (3*3) the loop executes from k=0 to 2
for(k=0; k<=m-1; k++)
{
//the first element of the diagonal starts form the k-th row
i=k;
//the first element of the diagonal starts form the first column
j=0;
//every diagonal end in first row
while(i>=0)
{
//prints the elements
System.out.print(arr[i][j]+"\t");
//decrement i by 1
i=i-1;
//increment j by 1
j=j+1;
}
}
//for loop for diagonals that starts from the last elements of the columns
//every element ends in last column so will execute loop up to n-1 (where n is the number of columns)
//here, k=1 because avoid to print a diagonal twice
for(k=1; k<=n-1; k++)
{
//here every diagonal starts from the last element of the last row
i=m-1;
//k iterate the starting element of each diagonal so; we have started j by k i.e. 1 
j=k;
while(j<=n-1)
{
//prints the element 
System.out.print(arr[i][j]+"\t");
//getting the next element in the diagonal 
i=i-1;
j=j+1;
}
}
}
}

            Output: 
           
            Matrix elements in diagonal form are: 
3	 2	7	8	1	9	6	5	4	

            Similarly, we can also print a matrix with any number of rows and columns.
