            Java Get File Size In this previous section of the Java IO, we have discussed various file operations such as write to file, read a file, rename a file, etc. In this section, we are going to discuss how to get the file size through a Java program. There are the following ways to get the file size in Java. 
            
            Using Java IO 
             Using NIO Library 
              
              Files.size() Method 
              FileChannel.size() Method 
               
            Using Apache Commons IO 
            Using Java IO The Java IO package provides the classes that deal with file-related operations. In the same way, the Java IO package provides the File class that contains the length() method. That returns the size of the specified file in bytes. It returns an unspecified value if the file denotes a directory. The way can be used if you are using Java 7 or previous versions. The Java File class is used to represent an abstract representation of file and directory pathnames. It belongs to the java.io package. In the following program, we have created a constructor of the Files class and parsed the path of the file as a parameter. We have used the following methods of the class are: exists(): The method checks whether the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname exists or not. It returns true if and only if the specified path exists, false otherwise. isFile(): The method checks whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal file. A file is normal if it is not a directory and, in addition, satisfies other system-dependent criteria. Any non-directory file created by a Java application is guaranteed to be a normal file. It returns true if and only if the file denoted by this abstract pathname exists and is a normal file, false otherwise. length(): The method returns the length of the file denoted by this abstract pathname. The return value is unspecified if this pathname represents a directory. The length, in bytes, of the file is denoted by this abstract pathname, or 0L if the file does not exist. Let's see the Java program. GetFileSize1.java 
           
            
import java.io.File;
public class GetFileSize1 
{
//path of the file	
static final String PATH = "C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\AMCAT ENGLISH.pdf";
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
//creating a constructor of the File class and passing the path of the file	
File file = new File(PATH);
//checks if the specified exists or the specified file is a normal file (not a directory)
if (!file.exists() || !file.isFile()) 
return;
//prints file size in bytes
System.out.println(sizeInBytes(file));
//prints file size in KB
System.out.println(sizeInKiloBytes(file));
//prints file size in MB
System.out.println(sizeInMegaBytes(file));
}
//the method calculates the file size in megabytes
private static String sizeInMegaBytes(File file) 
{
return (double) file.length() / (1024 * 1024) + " mb";
}
//the method calculates the file size in kilobytes
private static String sizeInKiloBytes(File file) 
{
return (double) file.length() / 1024 + " kb";
}
//the method calculates the file size in bytes
private static String sizeInBytes(File file) 
{
return file.length() + " bytes";
}
}

            Output:  Using Java NIO Library NIO is another Java IO library. It provides a different way of working with I/O in comparison to the standard IO library. It is an alternate IO API. The library is based on a buffer-oriented, channel-based approach for I/O operations. Files.size() Method The Java NIO library provides the class named Files. It belongs to java.nio.file package. The class provides static methods that operate on files, directories, or other types of files. In most cases, the methods defined in the class delegates to the associated file system provider to perform the file operations. In order to get the file size, the Files class provides the size() method. The syntax of the size() method is: 
           
            
public static long size(Path path) throws IOException

            The method accepts the path of the file as a parameter and returns the file size in bytes. GetFileSize2.java 
           
            
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
public class GetFileSize2 
{
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
//path of the file	
String fileName = "C:\\Users\\Anubhav\\Desktop\\morning_bird.mp3";
//method calling
getFileSize(fileName);
}
//function that calculates the size of the file
private static void getFileSize(String fileName) 
{
//Path: It is an interface that is used to locate a file in a file system 
//it typically represents a system-dependent file path
//Paths: It is a class that consists exclusively of static methods 
//it returns a Path by converting a path string or URI
//the get() method converts the given URI to a Path object
Path path = Paths.get(fileName);
try 
{
//invoking the size() method of the Files class that returns the file size in bytes
//and storing the size in a variable named bytes
long bytes = Files.size(path);
//invoking the format() method of the String class 
//that returns a formatted string using the specified format string and arguments
System.out.println(String.format("%, d bytes", bytes));
System.out.println(String.format("%, d kilobytes", bytes / 1024));
} 
catch (IOException e) 
{
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
}

            Output:  FileChannel.size() Method Java NIO library provides another class named FileChannel class. It is an abstract class that belongs to the java.nio.channels package. The class provides channels for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file. It provides the size() method to get the size of the file. It returns the current size of this channel's file, measured in bytes. 
           
            
public abstract long size() throws IOException

            Let's see the Java program. GetFileSize3.java 
           
            
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
public class GetFileSize3 
{
//path of the file		
static final String PATH = "E:\\pics\\fresh_fruits.jpg";
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
//Path: It is an interface that is used to locate a file in a file system 
//it typically represents a system-dependent file path
//Paths: It is a class that consists exclusively of static methods 
//it returns a Path by converting a path string or URI	
//the get() method converts the given URI to a Path object
Path path = Paths.get(PATH);
//creating a reference variable of the FileChannel class
FileChannel fc;
try 
{
//opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file	
//an invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
//fc.open(file, opts, new FileAttribute<?>[0]);
fc = FileChannel.open(path);
//the size() method returns the file size in bytes
long fileSize = fc.size();
//prints the file size
System.out.println(fileSize + " bytes");
//invoking the close() method of the Channel interface that closes the path
fc.close();
} 
catch (IOException e) 
{
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
}

            Output: 
           
            1382132 bytes   

            Using Apache Commons IO Apache commons is a third-party library that provides general file manipulations utilities. The classes belong to the org.apache.commons.io package. Using FileUtils.sizeOf() Method The class provides the sizeOf() method to get the file size in bytes. Syntax: 
           
            
public static long sizeOf(File file)

            The method accepts a file or directory as a parameter. Note that the parameter must not be null. It returns the length (in bytes) of the file if the parameter is a regular file. If the argument is a directory then the size (bytes) of the directory is calculated recursively. Note: It does not detect the overflow. So, we can get the negative file size due to overflow. Before running the following program, ensure that the commons-io-2.4.jar file is added to the project. GetFileSize4.java 
           
            
import java.io.File;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
public class GetFileSize4 
{
//path of the file	
static final String PATH = "D:\\SKYPE\\Skype-8.37.0.98.exe";
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
//creating the File class constructor and passing the file path into it
File file = new File(PATH);
//get the file size
long fileSize = FileUtils.sizeOf(file);
//prints the file size
System.out.println("The file size is: " +fileSize + " bytes");
}
}

            Output: 
           
            The file size is: 65042816 bytes
