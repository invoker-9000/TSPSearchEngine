Because food is such a crucial resource for humans. Harvest season is associated with various events. During this time occasions such as Halloween in the northern latitudes and Easter in the southernmost, devout commemoration and thanksgiving for plenteous harvests are blended. Patronal festivals serve a specific social purpose, such as commemorating or praising the gods, goddesses, or saints. They may offer entertainment, which became important to neighbourhood groups before the advent of industrially produced entertainment.

Festivals, such as the Saturnalia celebrated in Ancient Greece and Rome were closely tied with social structure, political processes, and faith.

Etymology The word "festival" was first used in the late fourteenth century, and it comes from Latin via Old French. A "competition dai" became a spiritual holiday, and its first recorded use as a noun was in 1589 (as "Festifall").

The word "feast" is also utilized in a commonplace mainstream speech as a synonym for any huge or precarious meal. It is most customarily refers to a non-secular festival rather than a film or art competition, in the Philippines and lots of different former Spanish colonies. The word gala is derived from the Arabic word khila, which means honor robe.

Traditions Most festivals have religious roots, and traditional activities combine cultural and religious importance. Harvest festivals, for example, celebrate the change of seasons.
