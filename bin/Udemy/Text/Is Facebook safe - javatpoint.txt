            Is Facebook safe? You may be concerned about account security if you use Facebook or intend to use it in the future. On the basis of the news about companies being hacked, personal identity theft, and information being stolen, whether Facebook is safe to use, you might be wondering.  In general, Facebook is a secure website. In order to keep you and your information safe, there is built-in protection available. SSL is a primary level of security that Facebook employs, which stands for Secure Socket Layer. This sort of security, in a nutshell, encrypts (protects) all data sent over Facebook from login information to chat conversations. Security is incorporated inside the Facebook servers, where your information is hold and secure. Hackers will be unable to break in, intrude, or steal your information since anti-intrusion procedures are in place. Antivirus and anti-spyware software are also used to maintain their computers free of viruses and spyware infestations. Facebook makes every effort in order to keep your information private and protected from anyone who might try to use it for accessing benefits in a threatening or illegal way. In addition to what Facebook already does in terms of protecting you, there are other measures to secure yourself and your data while on Facebook. You must establish a password when you join up for Facebook. This password is completely in your control, which makes secure your Facebook account, and can make it difficult for others in order to log in to your account. You should create a password with the help of using combinations of numerals, lowercase, and capital letters that are difficult to break by an unauthorized person. Your aim is to build a password that can only be cracked by you. Also, your password should be known only by you, and do not share your password with anyone even if they are a friend. That password is personal to you. Keep it near at hand to aid in the security of your account. Your password is unique to you. Keep it close at hand to help protect your account's security. It is very necessary to know how to spot phishing scams. For instance, delete an email if you receive it from Facebook and demanding for your personal information like username, password, or other secret information. You will never be asked for this kind of information by Facebook. Other people can obtain access to your account by sending you e-mails asking for your password. Your operating system, browser plugins, as well as Internet browser should be up to date, which is another approach to keep your account safe. This ensures that your system has the most up-to-date security features. Additionally, make sure your computer has an anti-spyware and antivirus program installed. Keep this application up to date at all times on your system in order to save the system against viruses and spyware infestations, as well as the theft of your personal data and passwords. Tip Maintain vigilant when it comes to preserving your privacy, regardless of Facebook's default settings. Check your Facebook privacy settings and make any required changes if you are a Facebook user. According to your preferences, only your friends should be able to access your photos, information, as well as profile. If you are using Facebook or planning to use it, there are few tips given below that can be used to keep safe information on Facebook. Cut off third-party apps A UK political agency, Cambridge Analytica, was exploiting Facebook data; it was disclosed by a whistleblower in a time. The controversy exposed how much information Facebook shares with third-party businesses and groups. Since the incident, Facebook has changed the settings for how third-party applications can access your data. It's a good idea to check through your settings again if you have not done so recently. Select "Apps and websites" from the left rail of the "Settings" screen. At the top of the screen, when you pick Applications and Websites, you'll see a list of all the apps and websites you've associated with your Facebook account. Now, you will be able to disable certain third-party apps or limit the data they can request from here. Below that, you may pull out the heavy guns and ban all third-party applications from accessing your Facebook account. Find the "Apps, websites, and games" area under "Preferences." To disable access to your account, select "Edit." If you completely opt-out of linking your Facebook account with third-party apps, you will be unable to log in to third-party apps or utilize Facebook's "like" and "comment" capabilities on third-party websites. Use outside blocking tools In order to keep your data, secure on Facebook, you do not need to depend upon Facebook settings. There are technologies available to assist you in taking your privacy to an advanced level. Two types of web trackers: browser fingerprinting and third-party cookies, can be automatically blocked by Facebook and any other third-party service with the help of using Safari web browser. You will need to take control of those trackers if you want to limit Facebook's ability to observe you. Thanks to third-party cookies, Facebook may track your behaviour on any website that employs it's like, share, as well, as comment capabilities. (If you wish to utilize those features after the initial prompt, Safari will let you do so.) Even when you erase your cookies, Facebook can preserve a record of your behaviour thanks to browser fingerprinting. Similarly, the Facebook Container plugin is provided by Firefox that helps to keep your Facebook account isolated your online activity on third-party sites. That is, if you use the Facebook share button, Facebook only knows about your online activity. Keep your location under wraps You have complete control over how much information Facebook has about the people in your life, whether they are coworkers, friends, or subway strangers. Disable the app's access to your phone's location services as a first step. However, this is not enough. The websites you browse and the apps you use can see your IP address, which identifies your location. So, use a VPN to hide it. A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection before linking you to a website or application, protecting it. In other words, you may be on a Florida beach, but depending on your IP address, the VPN could fool Facebook into believing you are in another location, such as London. Take precautions. You are not going to use any virtual private network. Make careful to pick one that has been thoroughly reviewed by privacy specialists. Note: If Facebook believes you're constantly using a different IP address, you will have to log in and verify your identity more regularly. Because using a VPN on a constant basis can be difficult, you will not be able to mask your location at all times. Finally, the advertisements you view will be targeted at those who are not in your area. There's always more Also, by not putting the Facebook app on your phone, you may avoid Facebook from adding your contacts to the information it already has about you. If you keep continuing down this path, your Facebook account will be deactivated in no time. Also, we have not even discussed the consequences of utilizing Facebook's other services, such as Twitter, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. You might want to give up those as well that will not stop other Internet behemoths like Google and lesser-known ad networks from snooping on you while you're online. Facebook is just the most famous ad network, according to David Choffnes, a computer science professor at Northeastern University who studies applications and privacy. Choffnes said that we are unaware of how widespread the corporations that follow our data online are or how they share it with one another.
