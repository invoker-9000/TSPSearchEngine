All recognized metals and numerous compounds had been investigated for magnetization by the end of the nineteenth century and all were determined to have had some magnetic property. The property of diamagnetism, the term for materials that display a mild repulsion by both poles of a permanent magnet was perhaps the most frequent. When placed close to a magnet, some materials, such as chromium, demonstrate paramagnetism or the ability to produce weak magnetization. When the magnet is withdrawn, the magnetization vanishes. Characteristics of Magnet A magnet has a few common attributes which are listed below: 1. Attractive property This attribute demonstrates that the magnetic strength somewhere at pole ends is high. 2. Directive property By holding the magnet in mid-air, this feature aids in determining which pole of the magnet is northern and southern. 3. Law of magnetic poles Similar poles oppose each other, whereas dissimilar poles attract each other, according to the rule of magnetic poles. 4. Pair property The Northern Pole and the Southern Pole may be discovered on both sides of a magnet even when it is divided in half. 5. A sure test of magnetization This test is used to determine whether a certain rod is magnetic or not by measuring the attraction or repulsion between the iron rod and the magnet. Magnetic Lines Of Forces The magnetic lines of force are drawn around the magnet in the given figure, showing the region wherein the magnet's force is measured. The magnetic field is the way of referring to this area. Whenever an iron item is brought near a magnet but not within its magnetic field, the magnet will not pull the object towards it. On the other hand, when an item enters into the magnetic field, the magnet's force is activated and the object is pulled. The structure of these lines of force conveys information about the nature of the magnet's forces. The magnetic lines of force, also known as flux, go from the north to the south. Properties Of Magnetic Lines Of Forces Magnetic lines of force are circular, constant curves that run through the length of the magnet's body. Within a matter, they move from the south pole to the north pole, while in the atmosphere, i.e. outside the magnet, they flow from the north pole to the south pole. At every position, the tangent to the magnetic line of force indicates the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic lines of forces never cross or intersect each other and doing so would result in two magnetic field values at a single place, which is not feasible. The magnetic field is greater at the magnet's poles because the lines of force are either entering or originating and are crowded together. While the magnetic field is weak away from the poles as they are comparatively at a fewer distance. The magnetic lines' intensity remains constant throughout and is proportionate to their proximity. When they travel from a high-permeability region to a low-permeability one, their density falls. With increasing distance from the poles, their density diminishes.
