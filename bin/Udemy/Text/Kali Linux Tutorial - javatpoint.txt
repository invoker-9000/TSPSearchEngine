Kali Linux tutorial covers all the aspects associated with hacking and penetration testing. Firstly, we will learn how to install the needed software. After this, we will learn configuration of network, basic commands, and tools for hacking, gaining access, post exploitation, and website hacking. What is Kali Linux Kali Linux was developed by Offensive Security to replace the vulnerable BackTrack Linux project. BackTrack was a Linux distribution, which was focused on security. BackTrack was used for digital forensics and penetration testing, and its first version was released on May 26th, 2006. Subsequently, other versions were developed with an update and advance features.  Finally, on March 13th, 2013, the defensive security team rebuilt entirely BackTrack architecture on Debian-distribution and released it under the name Kali Linux. In this way, the Kali Linux came into existence. Kali Linux Logo  Kali Linux is the industry's leading Debian based Linux distribution aimed at advanced penetration testing and security auditing. Mostly the packages available in Kali Linux are inherited from the Debian repository. Kali Linux offers tons and tons of hacking and penetration tools and software by default. It's quality is recognized in all parts of the world, even among the windows users who even don't know what Linux is or using Kali Linux these days.
