            What to do with an old computer You will eventually replace an outdated computer with a new one at some point in your computing career. On the other hand, when purchasing a new computer, many people are concerned about what to do with their old one or whether they should throw it.   Throwing an old computer is not the best decision if it is still working well. It may include confidential information and is harmful to the environment. Before you throw it away or send it to a respectable electronics recycler, there are various options for permanently deleting that data. Here are some suggestions for things you can do with an old computer. Use the computer for other things Many people assume that when they purchase a new computer, their old computer becomes antiquated and useless. Surprisingly, an old computer offers a lot of value; some are as follows: 
            
            Setup home network: Set up a home network if you do not already have one. As a client, you can connect the older computer to your network. An older computer can be used as a storage device or a backup once it is connected to the network. 
            Printer server: You can use the computer as a printer server if you have a home network or plan to set one up. You can use a printer server to share one or more printers among multiple PCs. 
            Alternate operating system: Linux and other alternative operating systems are growing increasingly popular. You can dual-boot into Linux operating system even if you want to use Microsoft Windows. Since Linux operating system is typically backwards compatible, that's why you can install Linux on an older computer. 
            Distributed computing: In order to solve challenging problems, several distributed computing projects combine the processing power of millions of devices. 
            NAS: Create network-attached storage (NAS) in terms of storing backups, movies, MP3 songs, and other sorts of information. 
            Give to kids or relatives Even if it is an older computer, most youngsters would want to have one in their room. Examine whether any of your children might be interested in using the family's old computer. There is a need to attention that if you decide to give this old computer and provide Internet access on this computer, make sure to keep an eye on that child when he or she is online. Check to see if any of your relatives are interested in using your computer. Setting up a computer for a family member who has never had one before, such as a grandmother, may have a huge influence on their lives. Donate it to a local school When you are purchasing a new computer, you can consider donating your old computer to a local school or hospital if it is not too outdated. It can be used as a testbed to disassemble and reassemble in a local school's computer lab (most have one), even if it is past its sell-by date. Local schools might utilize it for components as well; however, they may be cautious about using secondhand equipment because of the unknown lineage or wearing of older hardware. You would erase all data or all software that you have installed on your new PC, just as you would if you were selling a system, the last choice on this list. Also, ensure to include all license details for the software that you are keeping on the old computer system. Some local governments will give you contact information for non-profit organisations in your area that may be willing to accept your computer. If the requirements are suitable, Computer Aid International can also provide PCs to underdeveloped nations. Dedicate it to 'Distributed Computing' Do you wish to have a positive impact on the world? You can think of giving your old computer to one of the numerous open-source distributed computing initiatives that are available. [email protected] is arguably the most well-known. [email protected] makes use of global computing resources in order to help in protein folding research, which is critical to understanding how many diseases work. If your old PC has a recent graphics card, it may frequently assist and give additional processing power. Make it a Secondary Computing Server If you are a content producer, having a second computer in order to help with distributed rendering chores may speed up final renderings for complicated projects significantly. You will need to review your documentation because each program manages distributed rendering differently. However, on the secondary rendering system, you will usually install a lightweight application that will collect data and commands from the primary system after that offer result when it is finished. The rendering across several networked systems is managed by the primary program on your production machine or with the help of a separate manager app. Use it for spare parts or cannibalize it Remove any spare parts you think you will need for your new computer with the help of opening your old computer. Fans, hard drives, power supplies, CD-ROM, floppy discs, and memory are all items you may want to keep. In the event that the components in your new computer fail, the parts described above can be saved as a backup. Alternatively, you may increase the capabilities of your new computer with the help of adding components such as a CD-ROM, hard drive, or RAM. Sell it Selling a computer helps you to reclaim some funds for your new computer; however, it can seem to be more work than just getting rid of it. For someone who does not require a new computer, selling a computer might be useful for this kind of man. Furthermore, it is also helpful for the environment to find a new home for a computer. Computers can be harmful to the environment if it is discarded improperly as they contain a variety of valuable materials, including palladium, platinum, gold, and silver. Use it as a dedicated game server If you have a multiplayer game that you enjoy playing, you can think about making your old computer a dedicated game server; if it is a game where you can host a server on a local computer. Dedicated servers are frequently available in most multiplayer games that may be played online. Many of these dedicated game servers have the advantage of requiring very little system horsepower. Turn it into an experimental box You have most likely heard of Linux and want to give it a try. However, the think of attempting for setting up a dual-boot system on your primary PC makes you feel sick. On your old box, you can now experiment to your heart's content. Check out Ubuntu, the sultry Linux distribution that geeks adore. The good thing about Linux is that it comes with a lot of built-in support for older hardware, making it quite easy to set up. As compared to installing Windows, installing Ubuntu can be easier in some cases. There is also a plethora of free Linux applications available to try out.  It is possible, but it will take some time and work. The main hackintosh site is a fine place to start but be prepared for a lengthy and winding journey. A legal copy of MacOS must also be purchased. Recycle your computer If you cannot give your computer as a donation because it's too old, recycle it instead of dumping it away. Electronic trash, such as obsolete computers, is the fastest-growing waste source on the planet. This is owing to the shorter of modern electronic equipment as well as society's demand for most up-to-date high-tech items. Electronics can be properly recycled in your neighbourhood at reputable electronic recyclers. Users can search for a trusted recycler near them with the help of entering their state and city on the E-cycling Central website. Many electronic recyclers also provide collection services and events. There are extra steps you can take to guarantee that your old gadgets are recycled responsibly. If outdated equipment may be reused before selling it for parts, it is crucial to verify that your electronics recycler looks to determine. Reuse is always better for the environment and increases the life of electronic gadgets by a few years. Reputable recyclers will use mechanical shredding and a high-tech separation mechanism in order to extract the useful metals, which can then be transferred to a smelter, if refurbishment is not a possibility. Media Center Moving an old PC is to move it into your living room and repurpose it as a media centre is one of the most useful things you can do with it. With the help of installing and configuring Kodi or comparable software on your computer, you may listen to music, watch movies and TV shows, as well as play games. Because Kodi is made to be used with a remote, you can connect an old computer to your TV and surf while relaxing on the couch. One of the advantages of media centre software is that it does not consume a lot of system resources and is lightweight, which allows you to run it on even the most outdated hardware. Mineral Oil Cooled PC Building a mineral oil-cooled PC is another unrealistic yet beautiful PC project. Many components can be immersed in mineral oil without being damaged because it is not electrically conductive. In fact, lubricating them will help them last longer. Furthermore, because oil disperses heat, it can provide great cooling. However, this is another example where maintenance is a big nuisance, and reusing parts that have been in mineral oil necessitates a lot of cleaning. As a result, it's more suited to being used as a show PC as compared to a daily workhorse. Create a light-duty communal PC Most houses had only one desktop computer before everyone had their own smartphone, tablet, or laptop. These communal 'living room' PCs allowed you to access the internet and your email quickly and easily. An outdated PC may be used to create a similar setup. Place the gadget in a handy location and use it to rapidly check the weather, check your email, search the web, and among other things. Allow access to everyone in your home to join the community so they can benefit from the community setup.
