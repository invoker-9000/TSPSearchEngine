            Anagram in C This section will discuss the anagram and its program to check whether the given string is the Anagram or not. An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters in both the strings, except the order of characters can be different in the strings. In other words, anagrams are a technique of C programming that checks whether a given string contains the same number of characters, except that the sequence of characters can be changed in both strings. For example, suppose we have two strings: "CAB" and "ABC". Both contain the same characters in these strings, but the arrangements of the first strings' characters are different from the second strings, and the process is termed the anagram of strings.  Algorithm of the Anagram string Following are the algorithms of the anagram string in C, as follows: 
            
            Input two strings from the user. 
            Check the length of each string. If the length of the first string is not equal to the second string, the strings are not an anagram. 
            If the length of both strings is equal, convert the string's characters into lower case letters that make the comparison of the string easier. 
            After this, sort the characters of the strings using the built-in function of the C library to sort the strings. And if there is no built-in function, we convert the string to a character array. 
            We must sort the converted string into a character array. 
            And last, we check for the equality of the strings. 
            Example 1: Program to check the anagram of the string using user-defined function 
           
            
#include <stdio.h>

// function definition
int get_anagrm (char [],char []);


int main ()
{
	// declaration of the array
	char arr1 [50], arr2 [50];
	int count;
	
	printf (" Enter the first string: \n ");
	scanf (" %s", arr1);
	
	
	printf (" Enter the second string: \n ");
	scanf (" %s", arr2);
	
	// call function
	count = get_anagrm (arr1, arr2);
	
	// use if-else statement to validate both strings are anagram or not.
	
	if (count == 1)
	{
		printf (" %s and %s strings are an anagram of each other. \n", arr1, arr2);
	}
	else
	{
		printf (" %s and %s strings are not an anagram of each other. \n", arr1, arr2);
	}
	
	return 0;
}


// function defnition
int get_anagrm (char arr1[], char arr2[])
{
	// create two num arrays and initialize their value as 0
	int num1[20] = {0}, num2[20] = {0}, i = 0;
	
	// use while loop to check arr1 is not null
	while (arr1[i] != '\0')
	{
		num1[arr1[i] -'a']++;
		i++;
	}
	
	i = 0;
	
	// use while loop to check arr2 is not null
	while (arr2[i] != '\0')
	{
		num2[arr2[i] -'a']++;
		i++;
	}
	
	for ( i = 0;i <20; i++)
	{
		if ( num1[i] != num2[i])
			return 0;
	}
	return 1;
}

            Output 
           
            Enter the first string:
pine
Enter the second string
nipe
pine and nipe strings are an anagram of each other.

2nd time run:
Enter the first string:
pine
Enter the second string
nip
pine and nip strings are not an anagram of each other.

            Example 2: Program to check the anagram of the string using nested for loop 
           
            
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>

// define the no. of characters
#define No_Character 30

// use bool function to check the strings are anagrams
bool strAna (char *st1, char *st2)
{
	// create two arrays and initialized with 0
	int arr1[No_Character] = {0};
	int arr2[No_Character] = {0};
	
	int n = 0;
	// check the length of each string
	if (strlen (st1) != strlen (st2))
		return false;
		
	// use for loopto incremnet the array index
	for ( n = 0; st1[n] && st2[n]; n++)
	{
		// increment the string character
		// ascii value of a is 97
		arr1[st1[n]-97]++;
		arr2[st2[n]-97]++;
		}	
		
	// 	arr1 is compared using the assigned value
	for (n = 0; n < No_Character; n++)
	{
		if (arr1[n] != arr2[n])
			return false;
		return true;	
	}
}

int main ()
{
	char st1[50], st2[50];
	
	printf (" Input the first string: ");
	gets(st1);
	
	printf (" Input the second string: ");
	gets(st2);
	// call strAna function to check the anagram of the string
	if (strAna (st1, st2))
	{
		printf (" \n The first string is an anagram of the second string. ");
	}
	else
	{
		printf (" \n The first string is not an anagram of the second string. ");
	}
	return 0;
}

            Output 
           
            Input the first string: triangle
Input the second string: agtrinle
The first string is an anagram of the second string.

            Example 3: Program to check the anagram of the string using the for and if statement 
           
            
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main ()
{
	// declare the character type array
	char arr1[30], arr2[30];
	int len1, len2, num, i, j, found = 0, not_found = 0;
	
	printf (" Input the first string: ");
	scanf ("%s", arr1);
	
	printf (" Input the second string: ");
	scanf ("%s", arr2);
	
	// get the length of the strings
	len1 = strlen (arr1);
	len2 = strlen (arr2);
	
	// use if statement to check the length is equal or not
	if (len1 == len2)
	{
		num = len1; // assign the length to num variable
		for ( i = 0; i < num; i++)
		{
			found = 0;
			for ( j = 0; j < num; j++)
			{
				// check string is equal or not
				if (arr1[i] == arr2[j])
				{
					found = 1;
					break;
				}
			}
			
			if (found == 0)
			{
				not_found = 1; // assign 1 to not_found
				break;
			}
		}
		if (not_found == 1)
			printf (" \n The first string is not an anagram of the second string. ");
		else
			printf (" \n The first string is an anagram of the second string. ");	
	}
	else
		printf (" \n Both string must contains same number of character to be the anagram of string. ");
		
	return 0;	
}

            Output 
           
            Input the first string: SILENCE
Input the second string: LENSICE
The first string is an anagram of the second string.

            Example 4: Program to sort the string and check the anagram of the strings 
           
            
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <string.h>

// declaration of the functions
void cnvt_to_lwr (char []);
void sortArr (char []);

int main ()
{
	char str1[] = "course", str2[] = "source";
	int x, y = 0;
	
	// check the length of each string
	if (strlen (str1) != strlen (str2))
	{
		printf(" The given strings are not anagram of each other. ");
		return 0;
	}
	
	else
	{
		// convert string into lowercase
		cnvt_to_lwr (str1);
		cnvt_to_lwr (str2);
		
		// call sortArr() function to sort the arrays
		sortArr (str1);
		sortArr (str2);
		for (x = 0; x < strlen (str1); x++)
		{
			// check string is equal or not
			if (str1[x] != str2[x])
			{
				printf (" The given strings are not an anagram of each other.");
				return 0;
			}
		}
		printf ( " Both strings are an anagram of each other. ");
	}
		return 0;
		
	}

// function definition here
void cnvt_to_lwr (char a1[])
{
	int num;
	for ( num = 0; num < strlen(a1) -1; num++)
	{
		a1[num] = a1[num] + 32;
	}
}

// sorting here
void sortArr (char a1[])
{
	int temp = 0, i, l;
	
	for (i = 0; i <strlen(a1) - 1; i++)
	{
		for ( l = i+1; l < strlen (a1); l++)
		{
			if (a1[i] > a1[l])
			{
				temp = a1[i];
				a1[i] = a1[l];
				a1[l] = temp;
				 
			}
		}
	}	
	
}

            Output 
           
            Both strings are an anagram of each other.
