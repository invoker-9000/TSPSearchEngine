Some characteristics of Zombie Zombies can move, but they are actually dead. They don't have heartbeats and the other signs of life. Their body is in a decaying state. They are unable to speak. So they can't communicate, only groan and howl. They don't have any feelings and emotions. They don't show any kindness or mercy toward victims. They only need live human flesh. Zombies represent fears or anxieties. Zombies are dead, so they don't sleep like a human. Their strength is more than human beings. Zombie's greatest and only fear is fire.
