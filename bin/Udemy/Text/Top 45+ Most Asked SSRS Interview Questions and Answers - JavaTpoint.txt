          Top 45+ Most Asked SSRS Interview Questions and Answers 1) What is SSRS? / What is the full form of SSRS? SSRS is an acronym that stands for SQL Server Reporting Services. It is a complete server-based reporting platform that consists of functionalities and tools used to store various data sources. The SSRS reporting services consist of a complete set of tools that are used to manage, create and deliver reports and APIs. It also allows developers to synchronize data and report processes in custom applications and synchronize them. SSRS was developed by one of the biggest software companies Microsoft Corporation. 
           2) Explain the SSRS Architecture?  The SSRS architecture is made of integrated components. It is a multi-tiered application service included with the application, server and data layers. The architecture of SSRS is scalable and modular, and it requires a single installation across multiple computers.   
           3) What are the important architecture components of SSRS? Following is a list of the most important architecture components of SSRS:

           Table region 
           
           6) Explain the reporting life cycle of SSRS? The reporting life cycle of SSRS has mainly the following phases: 
           
           Development of Reports (Developer): It specifies that we have to design a report that the report developer primarily does. 
           Management of Reports (DBA): It specifies that DBA needs to ensure it once the report is being developed. 
           Security: It specifies that only the authorized user should access the report. 
           Execution: It specifies how the report will be executed to optimize data sources performance. 
           Scheduling of reports: It is required so that we can execute the report on the scheduled timings. 
           Report Delivery (DBA + Developer): It specifies that once the report is being developed and executed, the report should be reached to final recipients (business users) who will understand and analyze report data. If it gets any changes, we again go back to the development stage. 
           
           7) In which programming language the RDL files are written? RDL files are the extension for XML used for SSRS reporting services. These files are written in XML (Extensible Markup Language).  
           8) What are the different stages of Report Processing in SSRS? Following are the different stages of Report Processing in SSRS: 
           
           Compile: It analyses expressions in the report definitions and saves the compiled intermediate format internally on the server. 
           Process: It runs dataset queries and combines intermediate format with data and layout. 
           Render: It sends the processed report to a rendering extension to specify how much information fits on each page. It also creates the page report. 
           Export: It is used to export the reports to a different file format. 
           
           9) What is the Reporting Services Configuration file name in SSRS, and where does it exist? In SSRS, the name of the Reporting Services Configuration file is "Rsreportserver.config".

           30) What do you understand by the report snapshot? A report snapshot is a report that contains the layout information and the query results which we have retrieved at a specific point in time.  
           31) What methods are used to reduce the overhead of Reporting Services data sources? We can use the Cached reports and Snapshots to reduce the overhead of Reporting Services Sources.  
           32) Does SSRS report the Cache results? Yes. SSRS allows the cache reports over the reporting server. These cache results enable the users to access the reports faster because the report has been saved in your cache memory. 
           33) What do you understand by data-driven subscriptions? A data-driven subscription provides the solution to use the dynamic subscription data, which we have retrieved at the run time of the external data. It uses static text and default values, which are being used to specify when the subscription is defined.  
           34) How can we deploy an SSRS report? We can deploy the SSRS report in the following three ways: 
           
           By using Visual Studio: We can directly deploy the report in Visual Studio through the solution explorer by declaring the report server URL in project properties at Target Server URL. 
           By Report Server: We can deploy the report to the report server by browsing the report from the disk location of the server. 
           By creating the Utility: This is also an option to create a customized utility to deploy the report. 
           
           35) How can you store your query in an SSRS report or a Database server? We can store our query in an SSRS report or a Database server by using the storing procedure mentioned in the database server. The biggest advantage of storing the query in this way is it stores the data in the compiled format and gives all the advantages of comparing it using Adhoc reports. We can also store the SQL queries directly in the text form, but this is not a good practice.  
           36) What is the query parameter? What is the primary purpose of the query parameter? A query parameter can be defined as the combination of parameters attached to the URL's end. Query parameters are used as the URL extension, and it is mainly used to identify the specific content.  
           37) What are the drawbacks of reporting in SSRS? Earlier, for many years, Microsoft doesn't have any direct solution for reporting with the SQL Server besides Crystal Reports. Now, they have introduced SQL Server Reporting Services, but it also has several drawbacks. Following are the main drawbacks of reporting in SSRS: 
           
           Reporting in SSRS is newly introduced do it is complex to understand the complete functionality and structure of this new component. Many users who are more familiar with Crystal Reports find it difficult to use. 
           SSRS components like Report Builder and Report Designer are meant for different users for different aspects of the reporting process. The user must have a complete understanding and exposure to both to utilize these functions fully and extensively. 
           Many users face issues when exporting very large reports to Microsoft Excel, which can lead to a loss of data. 
           
           38) What is the difference between Tabular and Matrix report in SSRS? Difference between Tabular and Matrix report in SSRS: 
           
           Tabular Report: Tabular reports are the most basic type of reports in SSRS. In Tabular reports, each column relates to a column chosen from the database. 
           Matrix Report: In SSRS, a matrix report is the cross-tabulation of four groups of data. 
           
           39) What is the difference between Crystal Reports and SSRS? A list of differences between Crystal Reports and SSRS:  
           
           
             
             Crystal Reports 
             SSRS 
             
             
             Crystal Reports are easy to use, and it is built for those who have little or no programming experience. 
             SSRS is built around SQL Server, and therefore it is more powerful, but it requires someone who has a database background to work with it efficiently. 
             
             
             Crystal Reports provide a drag and drop solution so it would appeal to a broad audience. 
             SSRS is also easier to put multiple items on a page that work independently of each other. 
             
             
             Crystal Reports supports Windows and IBM environments. 
             SSRS supports Windows environment only. 
             
             
             Crystal Reports are accessible from PC only. 
             SSRS Reports exist on your server so that you can access them from any web browser. 
             
             
             Crystal Reports supports more data sources. 
             SSRS only supports Oracle and Microsoft data sources 
             
             
             Crystal Reports support the export formats HTML, PDF, XML, CSV, Excel, RTF, txt files only. 
             SSRS support all export formats. 
             
             
             You have to pay an additional cost for Crystal reports. 
             SSRS is already included in SQL Server installation, so you don't have to pay additional costs. 
             
           
           
           40) What are the minimum software requirements for the SSRS framework? / What are the software prerequisites to run SSRS successfully on your system?  Following is the list of software required for the SSRS framework / Minimum software prerequisites to run SSRS successfully on your system:

           Database: Needs SQL server 2000 with a minimum administration service pack 3 (usual, enterprise, and developer release). 
           
           41) What are the three different parts of the RDL file in Visual Studio?  Following are the three parts of RDL files in Visual Studio: 
           
           Data: The data part contains the dataset on which the query is written, and the data set is connected with the data source. 
           Design: In the design part, you can design the report. It is also used to create tables and matrix reports and drag columns values from the source. 
           Preview: The preview part is used to check the preview after the report run. 
           
           42) What are the multiple roles offered by the SSRS? Following are the multiple roles offered by the SSRS:

           Publishers 
           Report Builders etc. 
           
           43) How can you add Reporting Services reports to your application? Several tools such as Visual Studio / SSDT / BI Data Tools (Standard and Enterprise editions) contain a set of freely redistributable Report Viewer controls that make it easy to embed Reporting Services functionality into custom applications. There are two versions of the Report Viewer, one for rich Windows client applications and one for ASP.NET applications.  
           44) What do you understand by the term Snapshot Report? In SSRS, the concept of Snapshot Report refers to a pre-executed report containing the format of the data and the dataset utilized for the report. A Snapshot Report contains the following things: 
           
           It is utilized to store the report information dependent on calendars and spared to report servers. 
           It can also generate the report Snapshots in a review design when a client or application demands it. 
           When you decide on a report depiction for review, the report server gathers the report from the report server database. It presented the information and design present for the report when the preview was made. 
           
           45) What are the key advantages of the snapshots report?  Following are some key advantages of the snapshots report: 
           
           Report history: The reporting history is used to assemble a background marked by a report while making a report preview. 
           Consistency: Consistency specifies that the report previews give numerous clients reliable outcomes with indistinguishable information arrangements. 
           Performance: By booking huge reports to run during off-top hours, you can diminish the preparing sway on the report server during centre business hours. 
           
           46) What are the different types of data sources in SSRS? SSRS uses the following types of data sources:
