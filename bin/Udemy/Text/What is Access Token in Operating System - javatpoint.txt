            What is Access Token in Operating System An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it can hold additional free-form data attached while the token is created. Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege, for example, creating a new token with lower access rights to restrict the access of a launched application. An access token is used by Windows when a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors. In Windows, an access token is represented by the system object of the type of the token. In a token, the information includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. An access token is generated by the logon service when a user logs on to the system, and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database. The authentication database contains credential information required to construct the initial token for the logon session, including its user id, primary group id, and other information. The token is attached to the initial process created in the user session and inherited by subsequent processes created by the initial process. Whenever a process opens a handle to any resource which has access control enabled, Windows reconciles the data in the target object's security descriptor with the contents of the current effective access token. The result of this access check evaluation indicates whether any access is allowed and, if so, what operations (read, write/modify, etc.) the calling application is allowed to perform. Uses of Access Token The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges. Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens contain the following information: 
            
            The security identifier (SID) for the user's account. 
            SIDs for the groups of which the user is a member. 
            A logon SIDthat identifies the current logon session. 
            A list of the privileges held by either the user or the user's groups. 
            The default DACL that the system uses is when the user creates a securable object without specifying a security descriptor. 
            Example of Access Token This example shows the contents of an access token. The token only contains authorization information about the application's actions at the API, and such permissions are referred to as scopes. 
           
            {
  "iss": "https://my-domain.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": 
  [
    "https://example.com/health-api",
    "https://my-domain.auth0.com/userinfo"
  ],
  "azp": "my_client_id",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "scope": "openid profile read:patients read:admin"
}

            Elements of Access Token A typical access token holds three distinct parts, all working together to verify a user's right to access a resource. Following three key elements are included in most access tokens.  
            
            Header: It includes the data about the token's type and the algorithm used to make it. 
            Payload: It has the information about the user, including permissions and expirations. The payload is also called the claims section, and it is critical to the success of the token. You won't gain access if you want to visit a specific server resource but are not given proper permissions within the payload. Developers can place all sorts of custom data within the payload too. For example, an access token from Google can grant access to multiple applications (APIs), and all of those credentials are specified with just one access token. 
            Signature: It includes verification data so that the recipient can ensure the authenticity of the token. This signature is typically hashed, so it's difficult to hack and replicate. 
            Types of Access Token There are two types of access tokens available in the operating system, primary token and impersonation token. Every process has a primary token that describes the security context of the user account associated with the process. By default, the system uses the primary token when a process thread interacts with a securable object. Moreover, a thread can impersonate a client account, and impersonation allows the thread to interact with securable objects using the client's security context. A thread that impersonates a client has both a primary token and an impersonation token.  1. Primary Token Primary tokens can only be associated with processes, and they represent a process's security subject. The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations, requiring two different privileges in the name of privilege separation. The typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token and a logon service associating it to its operating system shell. Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process's primary token. 2. Impersonation Token Impersonation is a security concept implemented in Windows NT that allows a server application to temporarily be the client in terms of access to secure objects. Impersonation has four possible levels: 
            
            Anonymous is giving the server access to an anonymous or unidentified user. 
            Identification letting the server inspects the client's identity but not use that identity to access objects. 
            Impersonation, letting the server act on behalf of the client. 
            And delegation is the same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects (through the preservation of credentials). 
            The client can choose the maximum impersonation level (if any) available to the server as a connection parameter. Delegation and impersonation are privileged operations. Impersonation tokens can only be associated with threads, and they represent a client process's security subject. Impersonation tokens are implicitly created and associated with the current thread by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC, DDE, and named pipes. How do Access Tokens work? Users don't write their own access codes. Servers communicate with devices, and all the work completes easily in a few time. You need to follow the following set of steps, such as: 
            
            Login: Use a known username and password to prove your identity. 
            Verification: The server authenticates the data and issues a token. 
            Storage: The token is sent to your browser for storage. 
            Communication: Each time you access something new on the server, your token is verified once more. 
            Deletion: When your session is over, the token is discarded. 
            You can also use access tokens for single sign-on (SSO). Your credentials from one site become your key to enter another. Only you need to follow the following steps, such as: 
            
            Authorization: You agree to use your credentials from one site to enter another. 
            Connection: The first site connects the second and asks for help. The second site creates an access token. 
            Storage: The access token is stored in your browser. 
            Entry: The access token from the second site gives you entry into the first. 
            Requests for SSO expire quickly. Most requests expire within about 10 minutes, but some shut down the process after just 60 seconds. Security of Access Tokens Access tokens should be protected as they move through the open space of the internet. Companies that don't use encryption or protected communication channels could allow third parties to grab tokens, meaning unauthorized access to very sensitive data. It pays to be very careful. Most access tokens also expire. That simple step allows websites to ensure users are still online and active, which could help avoid large-scale duplication or deletion. Expiration dates can vary from company to company.
